Attractive valuations in other markets, particularly in Chinese stocks, will facilitate further selling by FIIs in India since Indian valuations are elevated. Concerns of earnings downgrades in H2 FY 25 render Indian valuations difficult to sustain. However, the sustained flows into the domestic mutual funds, where monthly SIPs have set a new record of Rs 24500 in September, will ensure that all FII selling will be easily absorbed by DII buying. This has been the trend in October so far.\\n\\nA healthy trend in the market is the leading private sector banks getting accumulated and showing resilience even in a weak market. This is the most attractively valued segment in this market where there is no valuation comfort. Lot of stock-specific action can be expected in the coming days in response to Q2 results.

      "    \"body\": \"In this Registered Report, we present a systematic comparison of statistical methods that have been applied to identify DA regions in scATAC-seq. To enable a comprehensive analysis, we undertook an exhaustive review of the literature to chart the landscape of statistical methods that have been used to perform DA analysis. We then applied each of these methods to a compendium of scATAC-seq datasets with matching bulk ATAC-seq or scRNA-seq datasets that provide a basis for comparison. We carried out a series of experiments to quantitatively assess the accuracy, bias, robustness, and scalability of each method for single-cell DA analysis. Moreover, these experiments also afforded us the opportunity to study more fundamental questions in the analysis of scATAC-seq, such as whether measurements within individual cells should be treated as qualitative or quantitative observations. The results of these experiments suggest best practices for the analysis of scATAC-seq datasets mode broadly. We have translated this understanding into an R package that implements these best practices in order to empower users to perform accurate DA analysis in scATAC-seq data.\\n\\nWe first sought to map the landscape of statistical methods that have been used to perform DA analysis. For this purpose, we conducted a comprehensive survey of the single-cell epigenomics literature. We identified a total of 118 primary publications that reported single-cell epigenomic datasets (Supplementary Data 1). This survey confirmed the widespread adoption of scATAC-seq (Fig. 1a). Chronological analysis revealed that the number of cells profiled in any given study has increased exponentially over time (Fig. 1b). Among the 13 statistical methods for DA analysis that were detected in this survey, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was the most widely used (Fig. 1c). However, no method was used in more than 15 studies, and many DA methods were used in just one or two published analyses. Beyond this unsettling observation, we also observed disagreement on fundamental principles of DA analysis, such as whether or not to binarize measures of genome accessibility (Fig. 1d). This lack of consensus is reflected in the variety of DA methods that are implemented by default within the most widely used analysis packages for scATAC-seq (Fig. 1e).\\n\\nOur survey of the single-cell epigenomics literature highlighted that the most widely used statistical methods in this field are based on, or identical to, methods that were originally developed for scRNA-seq. The application of similar statistical methodologies contrasts with the different facets of biology measured by each technology. Whereas scRNA-seq measures expressed genes, scATAC-seq measures the accessibility of the entire genome, and accordingly, we identified dramatic differences in the statistical features of scATAC-seq compared to scRNA-seq data (Fig. 1f). In particular, scATAC-seq measures a larger number of features compared to scRNA-seq, and each of these features are quantified by fewer reads and in fewer cells. These biological and technological differences raise the possibility that the statistical methods used for DE analysis of scRNA-seq data may be ill-suited to DA analysis of scATAC-seq data.\\n\\nIf the most prevalent statistical methods are not optimised for DA analysis, then they may overlook biological differences, or conversely, could lead to spurious discoveries. These possibilities compelled us to conduct a comprehensive comparison of DA methods for scATAC-seq data. As a prerequisite for such a comparison, we first recognized the necessity of an epistemological framework that would capture the biological accuracy of these methods. Whereas the majority of benchmarks in computational biology rely on simulated datasets, we previously showed that these simulations fail to appreciate essential aspects of biological data generation, and therefore lead to unreliable conclusions. Instead, we showed that comparisons of statistical methods based on real datasets with experimental ground truth do capture biological differences in the performance of these methods. In the context of scRNA-seq data, we showed that a close approximation to the ground truth can be obtained from matched bulk and scRNA-seq performed on the same population of purified cells, exposed to the same perturbation, and sequenced in the same laboratory.\\n\\nWe hypothesized that a similar epistemological framework would allow us to establish the biological accuracy of statistical methods for DA analysis. To enable this framework, we identified a series of published datasets in which matched bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq were used to profile the same populations of purified cells within the same laboratories. These matched bulk datasets provide a mechanism to evaluate the biological accuracy of single-cell DA methods.\\n\\nWe also postulated that the development of single-cell multi-omic assays, in which the epigenome and transcriptome are profiled in the same individual cells, would provide the opportunity to extend this epistemological framework. Concretely, epigenomic measurements from multi-omic assays can be aggregated to the level of genes, and therefore, we reasoned that these assays would allow us to compare DA and DE within the same individual cells. The biological hypothesis underlying this experiment is that DE genes expressed across biological conditions are likely to have promoters that are DA within the same individual cells. Previous work has established that this assumption holds across the genome as a whole when DE and DA are measured systematically.\\n\\nThe third and final component of our epistemological framework is the recognition that the biological accuracy of any statistical method is contingent on its ability to avoid producing false discoveries. We therefore compared DA methods based on their ability to avoid false discoveries in the absence of any true biological differences.\\n\\nWe first used our assembled compendium of matched bulk and single-cell ATAC datasets to evaluate the biological accuracy of each single-cell DA method, using the bulk data as a reference. Our survey of the literature identified five studies in which matching single-cell and bulk epigenomics data were collected from the same populations of purified cells and sequenced within the same laboratory (Fig. 2a). These studies collected between two to four scATAC-seq libraries per condition (Supplementary Data 2). We performed DA analysis of both the bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets, using each of the 11 DA methods that had been employed by at least two publications at the time of our literature review. We measured the concordance between single-cell and bulk DA analyses using the area under the concordance curve (AUCC), as employed by previous benchmarks of DE methods for single-cell transcriptomics data.\\n\\nIn our primary analysis, we observed that most DA methods achieved comparable performance, with relatively small differences separating the ten top-performing methods (Fig. 2b). Among these, methods that aggregated cells within biological replicates to form so-called 'pseudobulks' consistently ranked near the top. In contrast, negative binomial regression and a previously described permutation test were outliers that achieved substantially lower concordance to the bulk data than other DA methods.\\n\\nWe conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of these observations. First, we found that the performance of single-cell DA methods was largely unchanged when applying different DA approaches to establish the experimental ground truth within the bulk data (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Moreover, we obtained broadly consistent results when varying the number of top-ranked DA peaks used to calculate the AUCC, or when filtering peaks that were not accessible in at least 5% of cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Because calculating the concordance between DA analyses of single-cell and bulk ATAC-seq requires a matching set of peaks to be defined in both datasets, we also explored the impact of varying this peak set. In all of the above analyses, we had called peaks in the matched bulk ATAC-seq data, but widely used software packages such as Signac, ArchR, and SnapATAC instead call peaks in 'pseudobulk' samples created by pooling the single-cell data. We found that this procedure improved concordance between single-cell and bulk ATAC overall, but that the relative performance of single-cell DA methods remained similar (Supplementary Fig. 1d). To address the possibility that artefacts in peak calling might confound these results, we also devised a procedure to introduce spurious peaks into the peak sets, and found that the relative performance of the single-cell DA methods was largely robust to the presence of noise (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Finally, we evaluated concordance separately for peaks in promoter versus enhancer regions, and found that differences between DA methods were apparent primarily in the latter (Supplementary Fig. 1f).\\n\\nWe next identified four studies that employed multi-omic assays to quantify both gene expression and chromatin accessibility across tens of thousands of nuclei, each profiling between two and 13 replicates (Supplementary Data 2), and leveraged these datasets to repeat the comparisons of single-cell DA methods described in Experiment 1, now using gene expression as the reference (Fig. 2c). To enable comparison between the ATAC and RNA modalities, we aggregated chromatin accessibility around promoters into gene-level activity scores, as implemented in a number of widely used software packages. We then tested for differences in chromatin accessibility at the gene level, using the DE results from the matching RNA modality to define the reference. Moreover, we performed GO enrichment analyses of the differentially accessible genes, and evaluated the concordance between GO enrichment analyses of the ATAC and RNA modalities.\\n\\nIn our primary gene-level analysis, we identified a more pronounced difference between DA methods that aggregated cell-level chromatin accessibility profiles into 'pseudobulks' and those that did not, as compared to Experiment 1 (Fig. 2d). The former outperformed the latter, although all pseudobulk methods achieved comparable performance to one another.\\n\\nWe conducted a series of sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of this result. First, we verified that these results were not confounded by genes with overlapping promoter regions, since removing these genes led to slightly improved concordance but had little impact on the relative performance on single-cell DA methods (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We also confirmed that these results were largely unchanged when (i) applying different statistical approaches to establish the experimental ground truth within the RNA modality; (ii) varying the number of top-ranked DA genes used to calculate the AUCC, or (iii) filtering genes whose promoters were not accessible in at least 1% of cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b-d). Finally, previous work has shown that inferences about DE are generally more accurate for highly expressed genes, whereas identifying instances of true DE among lowly-expressed genes can be challenging. These observations raised the possibility that inaccurate inferences about DE for lowly-expressed genes might confound our analysis. Therefore, we re-evaluated the concordance after excluding the bottom tercile of lowly-expressed genes, and found that the relative performance of DA methods was essentially unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 2e).\\n\\nIn our primary Gene Ontology-level analysis, we again observed that the four top-performing methods all aggregated cells to form pseudobulks (Fig. 2e). We then repeated each of the above sensitivity analyses at the level of Gene Ontology terms. In general, the relative performance of single-cell DA methods was robust to the procedures used to identify the experimental ground truth within the RNA modality, varying the number of top-ranked GO terms used to calculate the AUCC, or filtering genes whose promoters were not accessible in at least 1% of cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b-d). In contrast, the relative performance of single-cell DA methods was somewhat more sensitive to the removal of genes with overlapping promoters or by the removal of lowly-expressed genes in the RNA modality, both of which improved the performance of the t-test (Supplementary Fig. 3a, e).\\n\\nNotably, in all twelve primary and sensitivity analyses at the gene and GO term levels, a pseudobulk DA method achieved the best performance. Moreover, no pseudobulk DA method ranked among the bottom half of lowest-performing DA methods in any of these analyses.\\n\\nThe possibility of profiling hundreds of thousands of cells with single-cell epigenomics presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the statistical power afforded by scATAC-seq data should enable the detection of subtle changes in chromatin accessibility between conditions or cell types. On the other hand, these subtle changes may represent technical artefacts or even false discoveries rather than true biological differences. We exposed similar opportunities and challenges in our recent analysis of DE methods for scRNA-seq, wherein we found that many of the most widely used methods can produce thousands of false discoveries in routine experiments. We investigated whether similar phenomena arise in scATAC-seq data. For this purpose, we conducted a series of analyses to assess the emergence of false discoveries in DA analyses of both real and simulated datasets.\\n\\nWe first investigated the emergence of false discoveries in random comparisons of cells from the same experimental condition. For this purpose, we repurposed a large scATAC-seq dataset to create artificial comparisons between cells from identical experimental conditions, with the expectation that any regions that are called as DA reflect statistical false discoveries rather than instances of true DA (Fig. 3a). In our primary analysis, we found that several widely-used DA methods identified thousands of differentially accessible peaks in the absence of any biological differences (Fig. 3b). Strikingly, the three most frequently used DA methods in our survey of the literature (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, LR, and LR; Fig. 1c) identified a median of 4664, 2505, and 8721 DA peaks within any given cell type. Conversely, methods that aggregated single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles to form pseudobulks never identified more than a median of 9 DA peaks in these random comparisons.\\n\\nThe premise of the above experiment is that any regions that are identified as DA between pairs of randomly assigned replicates are unlikely to represent biological differences. However, the nature of real-world data does not allow us to formally exclude the possibility that heterogeneity between replicates introduces true biological differences. Therefore, we complemented our re-analysis of published data with two simulation studies. In the first of these, we downsampled bulk ATAC-seq libraries to simulate scATAC-seq data with no biological cell-to-cell variation at all. In our primary analysis, we again observed that several widely-used DA methods produced thousands of false discoveries, but that pseudobulk methods were much less prone to false discoveries (Fig. 3c).\\n\\nTo achieve more precise control over the composition and properties of simulated scATAC-seq datasets, we leveraged a simulation framework originally developed for scRNA-seq data. We fit the parameters of this simulation to scATAC-seq data, and used the resulting model to simulate datasets that varied in the number of cells and libraries sequenced and the degree of technical variation between libraries. In our primary analysis, we again identified thousands of false discoveries from widely-used DA methods (Fig. 3d). However, we observed differences in the specific DA methods that were most prone to producing false discoveries in this simulation setup, as compared to either null comparisons of real scATAC-seq data or the simulation above based on downsampling bulk ATAC-seq data. We cannot exclude that these differences reflect an artefact of this simulation framework.\\n\\nIn secondary analyses, we established that the number of false discoveries was exacerbated by sequencing a greater number of cells or increasing technical variation between libraries, whereas it was reduced by profiling a larger number of replicates (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). These observations are consistent with the notion that accounting for biological and technical variation between replicates is critical to controlling the false discovery rate.\\n\\nIn our primary analysis, each replicate was simulated with the same sequencing depth, which is in contrast to the variable sequencing depths of replicates in real-world datasets. Therefore, we also carried out a secondary analysis whereby we deliberately simulated replicates with different sequencing depths (Supplementary Fig. 4d). This simulation markedly increased the number of false discoveries returned by most single-cell DA methods, although pseudobulk methods remained robust to false discoveries (Fig. 3e).\\n\\nTogether, these experiments emphasized that many widely used single-cell DA methods can produce thousands of false discoveries. Notably, these false discoveries were exaggerated when simulating more technically or biologically heterogeneous libraries. Conversely, DA methods that aggregated cells within replicates to form pseudobulks showed a markedly improved capacity to avoid false discoveries. We therefore also studied other strategies to account for variation between replicates in DA analysis. First, we explored the impact of including replicate as a fixed effect in generalized linear models. Second, we also considered replicate as a random effect by fitting negative binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). These experiments revealed that incorporating replicate as a fixed effect did not decrease, and sometimes increased, the number of false discoveries. However, incorporating replicate as a random effect enabled DA analysis without false discoveries (Supplementary Fig. 4e).\\n\\nIt is now well-established that many statistical methods for DE analysis of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data exhibit biases in the types of genes that are preferentially identified as DE. However, it remains unclear whether similar biases may affect DA analyses of scATAC-seq data. We hypothesized that the same biases that affect scRNA-seq data could manifest in scATAC-seq data as a bias of DA methods to preferentially identify peaks that are open in a larger proportion of cells, peaks that are supported by a greater number of sequencing reads, or peaks that are wider. To address these possibilities, we conducted a series of experiments using both real and simulated data to address whether these biases affected DA analysis of scATAC-seq data.\\n\\nWe first characterized the properties of DA peaks in the same published scATAC-seq datasets examined in Experiment 1. To control for differences in the total number of peaks called as DA by each statistical method, we ranked peaks by their p-values and limited our analysis to the top-1000 DA peaks called by each method. In our primary analysis, we identified a number of differences in the characteristics of the peaks preferentially called as DA by each method. Methods that treated chromatin accessibility as a quantitative measurement (t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, negative binomial regression, LR) preferentially called peaks supported by a greater number of reads, and open in a greater number of cells, as being DA (Fig. 4a, b). In contrast, methods that treated accessibility as a binary phenotype (Fisher's exact test, LR, binomial test, permutation test), as well as pseudobulk DA methods and SnapATAC's findDAR test, exhibited less bias towards highly accessible peaks. We observed less variability in the widths of peaks preferentially called as DA by each method, with the notable exception of negative binomial regression, which consistently called wider peaks as DA (Fig. 4c).\\n\\nIn secondary analyses, we varied the number of top-ranked DA peaks considered by characterizing the top-500 or top-5000 DA peaks called by each method. The trends observed for the top-1000 DA peaks were broadly conserved in this analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5).\\n\\nNext, we sought to specifically characterize the peaks that were spuriously called as DA in Experiment 3. We binned peaks into deciles according to each of the properties studied above, and computed both the absolute number as well as the proportion of false discoveries arising from each decile. Across all three false discovery experiments, most DA methods exhibited biases towards peaks supported by a large number of reads, which were open in a greater proportion of cells, and broader peaks (Supplementary Figs. 6-8). In contrast, methods that aggregated cells to form pseudobulks exhibited a lesser degree of bias, when they identified any false discoveries at all. Unexpectedly, we found that SnapATAC's findDAR test exhibited an unusual pattern of bias, whereby false discoveries preferentially arose from genes with intermediate expression.\\n\\nDifferential analyses of ATAC-seq data may discard differentially accessible regions with a log-fold change below an arbitrary threshold, on the grounds that regions with small fold changes are unlikely to be biologically relevant. Similar practices are ubiquitous in the analysis of other sequencing-based technologies, such as RNA-seq, where the choice of log-fold change threshold may alter the biological interpretation of a given experiment. These observations motivated an empirical assessment of the impact of log-fold change filtering on single-cell DA analysis.\\n\\nWe recognized that the quantitative measures of performance evaluated in these experiments (AUCC or number of false discoveries) are sensitive to the total number of peaks being tested. This introduces a potential confounding factor, in that simply filtering peaks at random would also be expected to increase the AUCC and decrease the number of false discoveries. To account for this effect, for each log-fold change threshold, we tested the effect of removing an equal number of peaks from the dataset at random. We then used this data to determine whether filtering by log-fold change increased the AUCC or decreased the number of false discoveries to a degree greater than random.\\n\\nWe first examined the concordance of DA between scATAC-seq and matching bulk ATAC-seq. As expected, increasingly stringent log-fold change filters increased concordance for all DA methods. However, the same effect was also seen when removing equivalent numbers of random peaks (Supplementary Fig. 9). When controlling for random peak filtering, we observed that the concordance initially decreased when filtering up to 70% of peaks based on log-fold change, and then increased when filtering 80% or more of peaks. To summarize these trends, we visualized the effect size of log-fold change filtering across all DA methods, compared to random peak filtering (Fig. 5a).\\n\\nWe next examined the concordance of DA between the ATAC and RNA modalities of single-cell multi-omics data. This analysis recapitulated the risks of log-fold change filtering. In this experiment, we found that log-fold change filtering consistently decreased concordance, relative to random filtering, when removing up to 90% of genes (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10).\\n\\nLast, we tested the impact of log-fold change filtering on the appearance of false discoveries. Relative to random filtering, we consistently observed more false discoveries across all DA methods when filtering by log-fold change (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11).\\n\\nOur survey of the literature identified substantial discordance not just in the methods used for DA analysis, but even in the representations of scATAC-seq data that are provided as input to these methods (Fig. 1d). Indeed, fundamental concepts in the representation of scATAC-seq data remain subjects of ongoing debate. Perhaps the most notable among such concepts is whether to treat scATAC-seq data as a qualitative measurement by binarizing genome accessibility. We asked whether the setting of DA could provide an opportunity to address this question. Specifically, we hypothesized that the accuracy of DA analysis could be used as a litmus test, in that approaches to scATAC-seq data preprocessing that enable more accurate and robust DA analysis are likely to also provide more accurate results at other steps in the analytical workflow. Accordingly, we repeated a subset of the analyses described above using binarized representations of the scATAC-seq datasets, with the aim of characterizing the effect of binarization on the biological accuracy, false discovery control, and biases of DA methods for scATAC-seq data.\\n\\nWe first tested whether binarizing scATAC-seq data would improve the biological accuracy of DA analysis, as quantified by the concordance to matching bulk ATAC-seq. Surprisingly, we found that binarizing scATAC-seq data generally increased the concordance between scATAC-seq and bulk ATAC-seq data, and the magnitude of this improvement was largest for the worst-performing DA methods (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 12a). The relative performance of DA methods was largely unchanged by binarization, with the exception of SnapATAC's findDAR test, which improved to rank among the top-performing methods when applied to binarized data.\\n\\nWe next asked whether binarizing scATAC-seq data could mitigate the appearance of false discoveries. This analysis yielded ambiguous results (Fig. 6b-d and Supplementary Fig. 12b-d). A subset of DA methods, including SnapATAC's findDAR test and negative binomial regression, consistently produced fewer false discoveries when applied to binarized data, although the magnitude of this decrease varied markedly across experiments. For the remaining DA methods, binarization did not have a consistent effect on the number of false discoveries.\\n\\nWe then investigated whether binarization modulated the biases of DA methods. Interestingly, in published scATAC-seq data, binarization attenuated the biases of some DA methods towards calling highly accessible peaks as DA (Fig. 6e-f and Supplementary Fig. 13a, b), although this attenuation was less apparent for methods that aggregated cells to form pseudobulks, since these biases were not apparent to begin with. Moreover, we observed that, for virtually every DA method, binarizing scATAC-seq data led narrower peaks to be called as DA (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 13c).\\n\\nWe additionally sought to specifically characterize the peaks that were spuriously called as DA before and after binarization, but found that binarization did not alter the more general tendency for false discoveries to preferentially arise from more accessible and wider peaks (Supplementary Figs. 14-16).\\n\\nCollectively, these results suggest that binarization can improve the biological accuracy of DA analysis, and this effect is observed for virtually every DA method included in our analysis. This observation is at odds with the argument that binarization is an unnecessary step that discards quantitative data collected in scATAC-seq experiments. We suggest that this apparent paradox can be reconciled by the observation that binarization generally reduces the biases of DA methods towards more accessible and wider peaks, even for DA methods that are less affected by these biases in the first place, and that mitigating these biases can outweigh the potential negative effects of binarization.\\n\\nAnother important open question in the analysis of scATAC-seq data is whether and how this data should be normalized prior to DA analysis. The majority of the DA methods considered in this study operate directly on count matrices or binarized data. However, three methods (t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and LR) are generally applied to normalized data, with the expectation that normalization is required to produce biologically accurate results. We therefore surveyed the literature to identify the approaches to normalization that are most commonly applied to scATAC-seq data, and then evaluated the impact of normalization on the performance of these three DA methods.\\n\\nWe first tested the impact of normalization on the biological accuracy of DA analysis, as quantified by the concordance to matching bulk ATAC-seq. In this analysis, no approach consistently improved over log-TP10K normalization (Fig. 6h and Supplementary Fig. 17a). The lone exception was the combination of TF-IDF normalization and the t-test, which demonstrated improved concordance relative to log-TP10K normalization.\\n\\nWe then asked whether specific approaches to normalization could mitigate the appearance of false discoveries. We found that the number of false discoveries was consistently reduced after applying TP10K or TP(median) normalization (Fig. 6i-k and Supplementary Fig. 17b-d). However, these two approaches did not improve, and in some cases decreased, the concordance between single-cell and bulk ATAC-seq data (Fig. 6h). On the other hand, the combination of TF-IDF normalization with the t-test, which increased the concordance between single-cell and bulk ATAC-seq data, also increased the number of false discoveries.\\n\\nWe further studied the relationship between normalization and the biases of DA methods. Interestingly, this analysis showed that numerous approaches to normalization can reduce the biases of DA methods towards highly accessible or broad peaks, relative to log-TP10K normalization (Fig. 6l-n and Supplementary Fig. 18). We additionally sought to specifically characterize the peaks that were spuriously called as DA under different normalization strategies, but this analysis failed to identify trends that were consistent across both DA methods and normalization strategies, and no method altered the global pattern whereby false discoveries preferentially arose from more accessible and wider peaks (Supplementary Figs. 19-26).\\n\\nCollectively, these results do not provide strong support for any alternative approach to normalization as compared to log-TP10K, which is the default approach implemented in several of the most widely used analysis packages for DA analysis. This conclusion is in line with a more systematic benchmark of normalization approaches to scRNA-seq data, which also highlighted the strong performance of log-TP10K normalization.\\n\\nLast, we evaluated a procedure proposed by the authors of ArchR to control for technical artefacts in DA analysis. For any given set of 'foreground' cells (e.g., cells of a particular type), ArchR constructs a set of 'background' cells of equal size that are matched according to a series of technical properties. By default, TSS enrichment and log(# of fragments) are used to select a matching set of 'background' cells. This approach inherently entails a trade-off whereby correcting for potentially confounding artefacts comes at the cost of using only a subset of the available data for analysis. Indeed, across all comparisons, we found that the ArchR background matching procedure substantially reduced the number of cells considered in any given DA analysis, from a mean of 4495 to 1264 cells per comparison (Fig. 6o). This decrease in the number of cells considered appeared to outweigh the positive impacts of controlling for technical variation, since we identified a uniform decrease in the AUCC across all DA methods considered (Fig. 6p-q).\\n\\nThe scale of scATAC-seq datasets is increasing exponentially (Fig. 1b). On one hand, the availability of hundreds of thousands of cells per dataset could increase the statistical power of DA analysis. On the other hand, past work in single-cell transcriptomics reported that the number of cell types identified per study was closely linked to the total number of individual cells sequenced in that study. This observation suggests that the increased statistical power afforded by a greater number of cells could be offset by an increased granularity of DA comparisons, each leveraging proportionally fewer cells. Moreover, many of the largest datasets are very sparse: for instance, the single-cell map of chromatin accessibility across 30 tissues reported by Zhang et al. demonstrated a median of just ~2800 fragments per cell. These trends raise the question of what minimum sequencing depth or number of cells are required for accurate DA analysis.\\n\\nTo address these questions, we performed downsampling analyses of the sequencing depth or number of cells per dataset. We first studied the effect of sequencing depth on the biological accuracy of DA analysis by downsampling the plate-based datasets used in Experiment 1 to a mean of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, or 10,000 counts per cell. We quantified the effect of downsampling on the AUCC by calculating Cohen's d relative to the DA analysis on 10,000 counts per cell. We identified a decrease in the concordance between single-cell and bulk DA in each case, as expected, with no evidence of saturation, suggesting that DA analysis continues to benefit from deeper sequencing up to at least 10,000 fragments per cell (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 27a).\\n\\nWe next investigated the minimum number of cells required for accurate DA analysis. To this end, we downsampled the number of cells within the droplet-based datasets used in Experiment 2. We limited our analysis to comparisons in which at least 1000 cells were sequenced in each experimental condition, and quantified the effect of downsampling on the AUCC by calculating Cohen's d relative to the DA analysis on 1000 cells per condition. In this analysis, the AUCC began to saturate when exceeding 300 cells per condition, although the degree and rate of saturation varied across individual DA methods (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 27b). These findings suggest that accurate single-cell DA analysis can be achieved with as few as 50-100 cells, and that sequencing more than 300 cells per condition yields diminishing returns.\\n\\nThe scale of single-cell epigenomics is continuing to increase. This observation underscores the need to evaluate the computational scalability of methods for DA analysis. Accordingly, we measured both the wall time and peak memory usage of each single-cell DA method in Experiments 1 and 2. We observed that the single-cell DA methods compared here varied by several orders of magnitude in both runtime and memory usage (Fig. 8a-d). Negative binomial regression, both variants of logistic regression, and the t-test typically required more than an hour to perform a single comparison within multiome datasets. Conversely, pseudobulk DA methods and SnapATAC's findDAR test were consistently among the most time- and memory-efficient methods, suggesting these methods could most readily scale to datasets comprising millions of cells. Moreover, whereas the computational requirements of all DA methods scaled with the number of cells in the dataset, this relationship was attenuated for these same five methods (Supplementary Fig. 28).\\n\\nFor some of the DA methods considered in our analysis, different implementations are provided in widely-used software packages, some of which have been reported to offer speed-ups of several orders of magnitude. These methods include the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Signac vs. ArchR), the t-test (Signac vs. ArchR), and negative binomial regression (Signac vs. glmGamPoi). For these three DA methods, we tested both available implementations. We observed that optimized implementations of these methods can markedly reduce the computational resources required to execute any given DA analysis (Fig. 8e, f).\\n\\nTo summarize our findings, we divided DA methods into top-, middle-, and bottom-performing terciles on each task that involved a quantitative comparison of DA methods (Fig. 9). This visualisation reinforced the excellent performance of pseudobulk DA methods across all of the experiments in this study. We suggest that these methods should be considered a first choice approach for the DA analysis of scATAC-seq data. We did not include mixed models in our primary analyses because they had not been used in a published study at the time of our literature review; however, we hypothesize that these may also offer improved performance relative to the methods that are most widely used at present (Supplementary Fig. 4e), albeit at the cost of substantially increased runtime and memory requirements.\\n\\nDuring the peer review of this manuscript, the reviewers suggested additional analyses that had not been preregistered. In this section, we present the results of these post hoc, unregistered analyses.\\n\\nFirst, we found that the concordance between single-cell and bulk ATAC-seq data was substantially higher for peaks located in promoter regions than for those located in enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Whereas our data does not allow us to establish a definitive causal explanation for this phenomenon, we found that peaks in promoter regions tended to be open in a greater number of cells, and supported by a greater number of reads, as compared to promoter regions (Supplementary Fig. 29). These observations are congruent with observations made in both bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq data and likely explain, at least in part, the greater biological accuracy of DA analysis for peaks in promoter regions. When considered in combination with the observation that the accuracy of DA analysis continues to benefit with increased sequencing depth up to at least 10,000 fragments per cell (Fig. 7a), these observations raise the possibility that increased sequencing depth would specifically benefit DA analysis of enhancers, although this possibility was not directly tested in the present study.\\n\\nSecond, we observed that filtering peaks by log-fold change between conditions did not consistently improve, and frequently decreased, the accuracy of DA analysis (Fig. 5). Our preregistered analysis involved removing equal proportions of peaks within each dataset on the basis of a percentile threshold. The question arose as to whether the imposition of a fixed fold-change threshold would affect our conclusions. Therefore, we repeated these analyses when filtering peaks with less than a two- or three-fold change between conditions. In these experiments, we again observed that log-fold change filtering did not improve the concordance of DA analyses of matched single-cell and bulk ATAC-seq (Supplementary Fig. 30), or between scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq from the same cells (Supplementary Fig. 31), and often substantially increased the number of false discoveries (Supplementary Fig. 32), all of which are consistent with the results of our initial, prespecified analyses.\\n\\nThird, the design of Experiments 1, 2, and 3 was preregistered before the results of Experiment 6 became available. In view of the observation that the performance of some DA methods benefited from binarization and/or alternative approaches to normalization, the question arose as to how these preprocessing strategies would affect the summary of DA methods shown in Fig. 9. A similar question arose with respect to the observation that the concordance between single-cell and matched bulk ATAC-seq was generally higher when calling peaks in performance in 'pseudobulks' created from single-cell data. To explore these points, we produced additional summary figures that compared DA methods across all primary and secondary analyses in Experiments 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig. 33) and across all binarization and normalization scenarios in Experiment 6 (Supplementary Fig. 34). These analyses corroborated the observation that some DA methods consistently achieved very good or very poor performance: for instance, in Experiments 1 and 2, DESeq2-LRT ranked among the top tercile of DA methods in all but two analyses, whereas negative binomial regression, the binomial test, and Fisher's exact test never ranked among the top tercile in any analysis. Considering all binarization and normalization approaches yielded rankings of DA methods that were broadly consistent with those shown in Fig. 9, but with some important differences: notably, SnapATAC::findDAR emerged as a top-performing DA method with respect to concordance with matched bulk ATAC-seq data, albeit not control of the false discovery rate, when applied to binarized data.\",\n",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\\n\\nChristopher J. Meade: Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. On our previous earnings call, we spoke to improving client sentiment and steadily improving organic growth. We sounded optimism about our growth trajectory in the second half of the year, and in the third quarter organic growth surged and BlackRock delivered some of the best financial results in our history. We generated $221 billion of net inflows, our highest net flows quarter ever. We delivered record levels of quarterly revenue and operating income. We expanded our margin by 350 basis points year-over-year. We generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest quarter in three years. Organic growth is accelerating as we execute on a strong pipeline and clients turn to BlackRock to move in size into public and private markets. Our structural growers, iShares, whole portfolio outsourcing in Aladdin, the structural growers all delivered strong third quarter growth and are poised to accelerate into year end. iShares, iShares leads the industry in global flows with approximately $250 billion through the third quarter and historically sees upwards of 40% of its total annual flows in Q4. Fixed income ETFs built chiefly on organic growth, iShares fixed income ETF assets now stand at over $1 trillion, nearly 40% higher than at year end 2021. And Aladdin, Aladdin logged 15% ACV growth consistent with our long-term low to mid-teens target with excellent momentum and key wins with growing clients. Finally, fixed income. Fixed income delivered across the platform with over $60 billion of net inflows. We believe a continued path of central bank normalization will support sustained inflows across bond funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts. Fixed income remains a compelling organic growth opportunity for BlackRock. Private markets are a strategic priority for BlackRock, delivering world-class private markets capabilities to more deeply-served clients across the whole portfolio. On October 1st, we closed on our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. The combination triples infrastructure AUM and doubles private markets run rate management fees. We're already seeing the power of BlackRock and GIP together. Our partnership with Microsoft and NGX, It aims to realize the enormous investment potential of infrastructure to support AI innovation. And it's just the first proof point of the growth synergies we can create together. We're bringing private markets to wealth clients. BlackRock manages more than $300 billion of assets across model portfolios and separately managed accounts for wealth managers. These portfolios would benefit from increased exposure and more efficient access to the private markets. We believe the model portfolio solution we're building with Partners Group will revolutionize access to private markets for wealth managers and improve portfolio outcomes for millions of households on an even bigger scale than what's been done with Evergreen Funds. And as long observed in markets, information about capital has become almost as important as capital itself. Our planned acquisition of Preqin is accelerating this exciting private markets data and analytics journey for BlackRock and our clients. Our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients through access to unique opportunities, expertise, and world-class client service. We're also moving swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to continue to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. We're building our mix towards higher secular growth areas like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates and model portfolios. We believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater diversification and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Successful execution of these goals should also result in multiple expansion for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with AUM near $11.5 trillion. $11.5 trillion units of trust, clients building with BlackRock. Our business tends to be seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and we maintain line of sight into a broad global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel organic growth. BlackRock generated total net inflows of $221 billion in the third quarter, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth. Third quarter revenue of $5.2 billion was 15% higher year-over-year, driven by 5% organic base fee growth, the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months, and alpha generation in our liquid alternative strategies. Operating income of $2.1 billion was up 26% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $11.46 increased 5%, reflecting a higher tax rate compared to a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter included $108 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by gains linked to a minority investment and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 26%. The prior year quarter included $215 million of discrete tax benefits, while the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $22 million of discrete expense. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $4 billion increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic base fee growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 4%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis point lower compared to the second quarter. This was due to the relative outperformance of lower fee U.S. equity markets and client preferences for lower fee U.S. exposures and lower securities lending. The closing of GIP added $116 billion of client AUM and $70 billion of fee-paying AUM on October 1st. We expect GIP to add approximately $250 million of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024. The GIP portfolios contribute competitive private markets fee levels that are typically over 100 basis points. They add primarily long dated non-redeemable assets to BlackRock's overall business, which further diversify our revenue and earnings mix. We expect these private market assets to positively impact BlackRock's overall effective fee rate by 0.5 to 1 full basis point. Performance fees of $388 million increased significantly from a year ago, primarily reflecting strong alpha generation over the last 12 months from a hedge fund with an annual lock in the third quarter. Quarterly technology services revenue was down 1% compared to a year ago due to the prior year quarter revenue impact of eFront on-premises license renewals for several large clients. Excluding this impact, technology services revenue would have increased approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, technology services revenue was up 2% reflecting successful client go lives. Annual contract value or ACV increased 15% year-over-year, driven by sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. In the third quarter, a large U.S. asset manager selected Aladdin to unify its investment management technology platform across public market asset classes. Our ACV results include the impact of this client announcement and a number of other new client mandates. Our results highlight the power of Aladdin as a unifying technology. Aladdin provides a highly scalable operating backbone to clients that's tailored to meet their needs. It enables new capabilities to drive top line business growth for clients, while also unlocking scale and efficiency. Clients recognize a direct positive impact to the bottom line. Total expense was 8% higher year-over-year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A, and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. G&A expense was up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend last year and higher professional services expense. Sales asset and account expense increased 6% compared to a year ago, driven by higher direct fund expense. Direct fund expense increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM. Our as adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was up 350 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue, significantly higher performance fees, and organic base fee growth. As markets improve, we've executed on our financial rubric, aligning controllable expense and organic growth, adding more resilience to our operating margin through greater variabilization of expenses and driving fixed cost scale. This approach is yielding profitable growth and operating leverage. In line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin and related transaction costs, at present we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024. And we would also expect a low to mid-single digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. In line with this outlook, we would also expect Q4 core G&A to reflect execution of planned technology investment spend at levels more consistent with Q3 and seasonal increases in marketing spend. We welcomed approximately 400 new colleagues to BlackRock following the close of the GIP transaction. Inclusive of the GIP acquisition impact, at present, we'd expect full-year core G&A expense growth to be closer to the high end of the previously communicated range of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. At the closing of the GIP transaction, we issued and delivered approximately 6.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock, subject to a two-year lockup period. Approximately 30% of the total consideration for the transaction or 5 million shares is deferred and is expected to be issued in approximately five years based on achievement of certain performance milestones. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter consistent with our previous guidance. At present, we expect our planned acquisition of Preqin to close around year-end 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. BlackRock's third quarter net inflows of $221 billion were well diversified and positive across client type, product type, active and indexed and regions. Momentum in our ETFs continued to build with $97 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Fixed income and core equity led net inflows of $48 billion and $32 billion, respectively. Precision ETFs had $20 billion net inflows as clients efficiently adjusted tactical portfolio allocations with tilts towards U.S. and international developed market equities. BlackRock's cryptocurrency ETPs continue to grow and added $5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Institutional clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with BlackRock, and our institutional franchise raised $56 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Our institutional active franchise saw $27 billion of net inflows, primarily in fixed income and multi-asset. Flows benefited from the funding of several large insurance and pension outsourcing mandates. We also saw positive flows into systematic equity, LifePath target date offerings, and private market strategies. Institutional index net inflows of $29 billion reflected large mandate wins and client-specific asset allocation and rebalancing decisions. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio inflows into U.S. active fixed income mutual funds. Fixed income flows were positive across our municipal bond, high yields, unconstrained, and total return franchises. Demand for our illiquid alternative strategies continued in the third quarter with $1.5 billion of net inflows driven by infrastructure and private credit. Net inflows also reflected the impact of successful realizations of over $3 billion, primarily from private equity and infrastructure strategies. Finally, cash management saw net inflows of $61 billion in the quarter, driven by both US government and international prime funds, and included multiple large new client mandates. Clients recognize the benefits of our scaled and integrated cash offerings, and this is contributing to sizable inflows of BlackRock. BlackRock delivered one of the strongest quarterly results in our history, and we're in an excellent position to grow with our clients, moving ahead into the end of the year and beyond. BlackRock's historically delivered outsized organic growth in periods of investor re-risking, around election cycles, and changes in central bank policy. The fourth quarter's also been historically strong for inflows, so we're staying connected with our clients. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and to grow our share. As clients increasingly turn to BlackRock, we believe this will result in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage, and earnings and multiple expansion over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\\n\\nLaurence D. Fink: Thank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully everyone has had a good summer and a really fun fall. Last week we happened to cross two milestones on the same day. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock becoming a public company and we closed our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. We're incredibly excited to officially welcome our GIP colleagues to the BlackRock family. We've enjoyed great connectivity with Adebayo and Raj and all the GIP founding partners. And we look forward to Adebayo joining our Board of Directors this quarter. Reflecting on these milestones and those came before, I believe our relationships with clients, with corporations, and with other partners are the strongest they've ever been. The long-term connectors and our relationship span many years as holders of company debt and equity. Our position as a consistent long-term investor differentiates us from opportunistic capital. We are not transactional. We are effectively perpetual capital, particularly through our index holdings. Those longstanding relationships, underpinned by long-term ownership positions are unlocking differentiated partnerships, especially as we expand into private markets. We founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them. BlackRock has grown as the capital markets have become a bigger and bigger part of the global economy. In my conversations with clients and policymakers around the world, I hear how more and more countries recognize the power of American capital markets and would like to build their own type of capital markets. Record government deficits and tighter bank lending means people, companies, and countries will increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirements, their business, and their economies. The growth and prosperity generating power of the capital markets will remain a dominant economic trend in the coming decades. And BlackRock will be an important player in that growth. The opportunities ahead are never been better than we've seen now. We see this through unique deals and partnerships with BlackRock at the center and are an accelerating client activity. 2024 net inflows have already surpassed the full year net inflows of both 2022 and 2023. The asset we manage on behalf of our clients reached a new high, ending the third quarter at $11.5 trillion. AUM has grown $2.4 trillion or 26% over the last 12 months. In that time, clients have entrusted BlackRock with $456 billion of net assets, including a record $221 billion in the third quarter. Third quarter net inflows and corresponding organic base fee growth of 5% represents our highest level in the last three years. And 15% technology services ACV growth is also at a fresh high. On our earnings calls earlier this year, we discussed with our shareholders our visibility to a strong pipeline. We shared how this would lead to accelerating organic growth in the second half and we're seeing that in our results today. We continue to grow our pipeline across the breadth of the Aladdin investment management mandates and we expect momentum to further build into year-end in 2025. We are effectively leveraging our technology, our scale and our global footprint to deliver profitable growth. Quarterly revenues and operating income both set new records, up 15% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. And our 45.8% operating margin is up 350 basis points. Importantly, organic growth has great breadth and is diversified across BlackRock. Above the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, flows were positive and active and indexed across all asset classes, across all client types, and across all regions. Actives have contributed $28 billion in the third quarter, including positive results in active equities. ETFs remain a secular growth driver, adding $97 billion in net inflows in the quarter and $248 billion year-to-date. We're seeing a broadening of ETF adaptation globally, leading to increased levels of utilization which we believe will only continue. A number of significant whole portfolio institutional mandates funded in the quarter, and we continue to be chosen for large global solutions. Last month we were selected as a fiduciary manager for over $30 billion dollar Dutch pension fund with more than 30,000 members. Our performance, our technology, and our in-depth knowledge of local investment nuances increasingly make us the preferred partner for institutional clients. Many investors have large cash holdings. Money market industry assets are hitting new records in the quarter, including BlackRock's own cash position, which had $61 billion in net inflows. But investors will have to re-risk to meet their long-term return needs. And we see great opportunities in investors across a number of structural trends continue to build this. These include rapid advancements in technology and AI and rewiring of globalization and the unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is exceptionally well positioned in front of that $9 trillion of money market funds across the industry as it makes its way into public and private markets. We are connecting our clients to opportunities and working with them in an integrated whole portfolio lens to help them deploy their capital. We know our strategy is ambitious and our strategy is working. Black market is becoming the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. Private markets are becoming increasingly important in the financing of the economy. Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets and powering economic growth. These dynamics are reshaping the landscape of how our clients invest and how they allocate capital within their portfolios. Throughout our history, we have never shied away from making big bets to better serve our clients. As we did when we created Aladdin, unlocking new markets through ETFs and pioneered whole portfolio advisory across active and index, we made coordinated investments to bring private market opportunities to our clients in a better way. By an enthusiasm for the planned integration of GIP and the closing of Preqin has exceeded our own high expectations. Our clients are excited to see how GIP and Preqin capabilities are amplified by being part of BlackRock. The private markets and the client's allocation to them will continue to grow. Standardized, transparent private market data and analytics will be increasingly important. As with Aladdin, we believe we can add more value to Preqin as both a user and a provider of private market data and risk analytics. Aladdin expanded into new asset classes and markets as BlackRock and our own clients evolved. And we expect the same for Preqin. The growth of private markets is underpinned by the continued rise of infrastructure. It presents a generational investment opportunity. Over the next 15 years, the world will need to invest $75 trillion to repair aging infrastructure to invest in new projects like data centers and decarbonization technology. The current cash flow inflation-protected return profile of infrastructure makes it an attractive sector for our clients, most of whom will represent investor savings for retirement. For the close of GIP, we are now offering our clients access to market-leading investment and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. Clients will benefit from a substantial scale as the second largest private market infrastructure managers in the world, with $170 billion in client assets. We have differentiated performance. GIP brings a track record of well-timed and disciplined entries into strategic exits, having returned over $45 billion of capital to investors. With higher rates, distributions to paid-in capital are a critical measure of success in where we are an industry leader. The combination of BlackRock's infrastructure platform with GIP is already unlocking meaningful opportunity for our clients. We recently announced our partnership with Microsoft and MGX to launch the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership. We will make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet growing demand for compute power. We will also invest in energy infrastructure needed to create new sources of power for these facilities. Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion dollar long-term investment opportunity. BlackRock is uniquely positioned at the center of this opportunity through our longstanding relationships with corporates, including hyperscalers and energy suppliers and governments around the world. We look forward to be working with our stakeholders in this ecosystem to navigate opportunities and challenges while we also are delivering investment returns for our clients. This partnership is a powerful demonstration on how our expanded capabilities will enable us to do even more with our clients investing in one of the largest growth imperatives in the coming decades. In addition to infrastructure, private credit is an important component of our client's portfolio. We've grown our own broader private market -- private debt business organically and inorganically in recent years. Today we manage over $85 billion in diversified across lending, investment grade, private placement, infrastructure and real estate debt. And we've been a top 10 fundraiser over the last decade. BlackRock's nearly $4 trillion in assets across public fixed income cash and private credit means we both provide integrated fixed income solutions for our clients and deliverable scale benefits. Our scale enhance our proprietary deal sourcing access to the execution of deal flow, deeper liquidity, lowering trading costs, all of which benefits each and every one of our clients. Private markets have mainly been accessible to institutional investors while private wealth holding underweight by comparison. For many wealth investors, the addition of private markets to the portfolio may provide diversification benefits to better returns. To help bridge this gap, we recently announced a partnership with a Partners Group to develop a first-of-its-kind private markets model portfolio solution. We believe it will transform retail access by enabling financial advisors and their clients to add broad-based exposures to the private markets, including to the BlackRock funds. We continue to innovate new investment strategies to improve private market access for our clients backed by our own investment expertise, our proprietary sourcing of deals, and our technology. As market complexities and opportunities grow, clients need to scale enablers like Aladdin. Clients use Aladdin to consolidate a patchwork of legacy technologies resulting in greater and better business agility and resilience. It combines risk management, the investment book of record, its performance, its accounting, its risk, and data all on one platform. Clients research shows that Aladdin's scalable capabilities allow clients to grow faster, operate more efficiently, better risk management with their technology spend over the long term. The power of Aladdin is resonating with both asset owners and managers. The ACV growth reflected several significant client mandates, including a large public asset manager, and one of our largest Aladdin assignments ever. Aladdin is core to the consistent performance our portfolio managers deliver for clients. We leverage our investment insights and technology to bring the performance they demand and deserve. Flows into BlackRock active strategies accelerated in the third quarter with $28 billion of net inflows, bringing our year-to-date total of $39 billion. This includes demand for active equities led by our high-performing quant strategies, where more than 90% of the AUM is above the one, three, and five year period. Across asset classes, investment performance remains strong over the long run. This is resonating in our active flows and our liquid performance fees, and performance positions us well for future growth. Index ETFs are increasingly being used with an active management and the ETF structure is being used to pair the alpha generation of leading investors with the liquidity, tax efficiency and transparency offered by ETFs. These dynamics are contributing to client demand globally for iShares ETFs. BlackRock generated in the third quarter ETF net inflows of $97 billion. ETF flows were positive across all segments and major regions, including double-digit organic growth in Europe. There's more to come with the fourth quarter, which typically brings our seasonally strongest period of the year. iShares fixing an ETF platform recently cost $1 trillion in assets, and standalone, it would be a top-five bond manager by itself. Assets have nearly doubled over the last five years. All of that growth has been organic and mostly in a flat to down fixed income beta environment. A more normalized, relatively high rate environment has the potential to encourage investors back even more into fixed income. We continue to innovate in our exchange traded products to provide better access to markets. This quarter we launched our Ethereum ETF which has garnered more than $1 billion of net inflows in the first two months of trading. It follows the successful launch of our Bitcoin product, which has now grown to $23 billion in its first nine months. And we will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable. On October 1st, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading somewhere around $960. When we went public, it was with a belief in the importance of growth and the depth of the global capital markets. We wanted to share our success with a broader population of people investing for the future, including our employees that all still holds true today. Our relentless focus on clients, having a growth mindset and a willingness to change and evolve has generated a compounded annual total return of over 20% for our shareholders since our IPO 25 years ago. BlackRock has exceeded the total return of the S&P 500 in 19 of those 25 years, representing a business model to serve all our stakeholders. We are better positioned than ever to serve our clients and to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come. I've never felt more optimistic in our positioning as I do today, even after 25 years of being a public firm and 37 years of being a firm. I want to thank all the BlackRock employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and serving our clients with excellence. And again, we welcome our new colleagues and clients from GIP. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Hey, Craig.\\n\\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, Martin. Hope everyone's doing well. So my question is on the net flow trajectory. From your broad-based client conversations and your current institutional and funded wind pipeline, do you expect the acceleration of re-risking activity continue into next year post the election? And if your long-term net flows strengthen or stay strong given that they're already pretty strong in the third quarter. Should we expect any outflows in your money market business, which I know might be somewhat protected given the institutional scale?\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Thanks, Craig, for the question. So new inflows are strong, as you said, very healthy on any and all of the measures we track. No question, Craig, we're winning share with our clients. The $221 billion of Q3 flows, they showed great breadth across the business. Positive flows in U.S. active fixed income mutual funds, systematic equity, LifePath target date. Larry talked about just our long-term active business really shows resilience. Since 2019, I think we've had positive active flows in 18 of 23 quarters. So, we just continue to have a very strong flow performance, 25% higher than full year 2023, and we still have this seasonally strong Q4 ahead. So, we feel like a very healthy trajectory on asset growth. It's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things with clients. And I think for where we are in the cycle, BlackRock's always been a meaningful out performer in re-risking periods. So going back to previous election cycles or central bank action, if you look at BlackRock, we had outsized upside capture if that was in 2017, 2018, 2021, and we saw very strong organic asset growth as well as organic base fees growth that was over our long-term targets. So we see that the market and we think the world is lining up for that with our clients. And then with respect to money markets, our business is largely institutional. It's been very durable. The $61 billion of flows that's come there I think have been good. The trajectory has been very strong this year. I think Craig when we look at it, our money market fund business is at $850 billion today. It's nearly 70% bigger than it was five years ago. Cash is a meaningful part of client portfolios, but we're seeing that sort of return to fixed income as well, which has been good for the flow trajectory.\\n\\nLaurence D. Fink: I would just add one thing is, as the global capital markets become a larger player in the economic activity here and other places in the world, the opportunity for us and our positioning for us is fantastic. And that will allow the backdrop for better flows and more exciting opportunities.\\n\\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, congratulations on the strong quarter here. Great to see the meaningful operating leverage as well in the quarter. Just curious how you're pacing investments spent here into 2025. How is that evolving? And what are some of the levers to drive margining in the 12 to 18 months? Maybe you can update us on where you are along the journey of variablizing your expenses.\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it. It's Martin. So just contextually, right, our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate industry-leading differentiated organic growth, to drive operating leverage and industry-leading margins and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy. We've got a strong track record at BlackRock of investing in the business for growth and scale, while also expanding profitability. It's not just about growth, it's about profitable growth over the long term. As our growth comes from being very disciplined in making and managing continued investments in our business. We've dubbed this our financial rubric, which I mentioned. We size our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variablizing more expenses where we can, and we've made a lot of progress there. And most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed cost scale, especially through investments in technology. We've got a consistent track record of delivering industry leading margins and improving them. And I'd say the scale indicators, they're really coming through the results. We generated 350 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, while operating income rose 26%. And since the end of 2022, BlackRock assets under management are up $3 trillion, while headcount is broadly flat. So we're delivering the benefits of scale and productivity which showing our margin expansion. We continue to believe that technology, automation, firm foot printing are the major levers there for us to continue to drive that margin expansion. The last thing I'd say is just market movements, market movements beta, that's our highest margin item, both when markets move meaningfully up or down. And we continue to see conditions for reasonably positive growth in the markets over the near to intermediate term. So we believe we can continue to invest to accelerate organic growth and deliver margin expansion using this financial rubric that we've laid out.\\n\\nAlex Blostein: I'm good, thanks. Question for you guys on private markets, there's a couple of topics, but maybe starting with GIP, helpful to maybe just to get a market to market on some of the financial elements. I know Martin, you talked about $250 million, I think, in management fees in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving into 2025? What are some of the kind of fun flow dynamics on the legacy GIP side and what are some of the things that you guys are working with them together? And also if you could just remind us what the operating margin on that business is as well out of the gate as well. Thanks.\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Thanks Alex. So just the closing of GIP, it's a great milestone in BlackRock's history. We're really excited to welcome over 400 new colleagues, to welcome the leadership team, Adebayo, Raj, Michael, John, everybody. Our clients are excited. The consultants that we've been working with are excited. The corporate partners are excited. So we're really eager to partner on this new platform. And the reception, as Larry mentioned, has been overwhelmingly positive. For us, this is a revenue growth story. This is about expanding capabilities. We're working to unlock substantial growth synergies across origination, capital formation, and platform scale. We're seeing excellent momentum in fundraising for -- across the platform at GIP, at BlackRock, and have, I'd say, really strong ambitions, especially around the AI Innovation Fund that Larry mentioned. As I mentioned on the call in my earlier remarks, we're consolidating $116 billion of GIP AUM, client AUM, $70 billion of fee-paying AUM. We're doubling private markets run rate management fees at BlackRock in the transaction. Think about GIP adding, as we said on the call, annualized north of $400 million of earnings at sort of 50-ish percent margins, $250 million in management fees we expect to come in the fourth quarter. So I'd model sort of a $1 billion of fees with an FRE margin north of 50% when we think about 2025 in terms of GIP.\\n\\nDan Fannon: Okay, great. Sorry about that. I was hoping you could discuss your appetite for additional M&A and what constraints you have financially, but more importantly as a management team to appropriately integrate the recent deals and really maximize the opportunity you have with these transactions?\\n\\nMartin S. Small: All right, thanks so much for the question. As I said, we're really excited for our clients about GIP and Preqin. This is a meaningful accelerant in our private markets capabilities. And I think just, as I mentioned in the last question, it's a major financial contributor for BlackRock, but it's going to take some work to integrate well and realize the plan synergies of the transaction. So right now we're very focused on integrating GIP and closing Preqin, and we're focused on delivering a great integration experience for clients and employees. We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business. And inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets. Look at this quarter, we've hit our 5% organic base fee growth target and we see excellent momentum. So, we'll continue to be prudent with our capital and financial position and consistent with our long-term approach. We'll evaluate inorganic opportunities that have the benefit for our clients and shareholders. We're always going to be very rigorous and selective in those criteria and entertain possibilities that have clear alignment with our culture, strategy and long-term organic growth. We have great capabilities here, Dan. So across infrastructure now, we've got $170 billion platform. We have an $85 billion private credit platform. We have a huge opportunity to grow inorganically in private credit with our insurance clients. We're the largest core fixed income manager in the world for insurance companies -- organic, we have the largest organic opportunity to grow -- organic opportunity to grow with our insurance clients. We manage $700 billion of insurance company general account assets for them. So if you think about the conversations we're having with CIOs to integrate our private credit capabilities into that GA. If we can just flip seven -- if we can flip 10% of the $700 billion into private credit strategies, that's $70 billion of opportunity sitting with existing clients with the capabilities that we have today.\\n\\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. So I think we're all pretty impressed with the broad growth that you keep putting up and huge margins too. So, I want a high-level question. You mentioned the word multiple expansion once or twice during the conversation and it's just -- I think earnings growth needs to be part of the equation too. When you have strong growth and everything, you have big margins. I'm just curious why 5% EPS growth this quarter, should we expect these initiatives as they layer in and you consistently hit your base fee targets to actually bring the earnings growth along with it too. I appreciate that. Thanks.\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Thanks so much for the question, Glenn. So we're focused on driving differentiated organic growth, meeting our 5% organic growth targets through the cycle driving operating leverage. And as you said, I think you see those results very much coming through. We think if we are able to drive 5% organic growth, continue to execute on this financial rubric I laid out. We should be able to drive industry-leading margins and margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. I think in the quarter, I mentioned our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter. And that's the main driver between some of that lighter EPS here was the $22 million of discreet expense that we had in this quarter versus the $215 million of benefit that we had last year from discreet.\\n\\nBrian Bedell: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just back to the 5% organic base fee growth and maybe a different angle on this in terms of the fee rate. Obviously, the rate is going up with the GIP acquisition of that 0.5 to 1 basis point. Do you feel better now than you have maybe in a long time on the potential for the fee rate to either be stable or even move up sequentially in the next several years versus the fee pressure that you've seen. And I know it's all been due to mix in the past, but now the composition of your future organic growth seems to be tilted more towards the private markets, towards higher fee products versus, obviously, some of the lower mandates that you've been bringing in and also the core iSeries -- iShares, [Core Series] (ph) iShares, sorry. So bottom line is, do you feel better about that fee rate growth potential? And maybe if you can just touch on the model portfolios partnership as well in terms of the organic growth potential there.\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. So we generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter. So 5% annualized organic base fee growth. We're excited about that. Continue to see great momentum just in our organic growth. We're growing revenues and operating income at double digit rates and expanding margin. Average AUM growth was 18% higher than base fee growth, and that was mainly due to relative outperformance of lower fee rate US equities, or what you all in our analyst community would call divergent beta. So spot AUM of $11.5 trillion ended the quarter about 4% higher than average AUM. And so our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis point lower sequentially. More macro just on the fee rate. On our AUM, the fee rate, it's a backward-looking output basically of the mix of the stock of assets that we manage and net new flows and net new fields on the fee rate. It's primarily affected by beta and FX and also by organic growth. And so over more recent periods, US public equity markets, which are a lower fee rate segment, They've grown faster than international equities. And that's been a driver of these fee rate trends on our platform. And in those environments of strong US equities, also the new base fee growth tends to occur at relatively lower fields to international or EM equities. Fee rate for us, it's primarily an output. It's not the basis or driver of the strategy. We're focused on meeting client needs across the whole portfolio. We're focused on technology. We're focused on driving organic growth in the most efficient way possible. But I do think you're grabbing on the point that we see, which is as we grow our private markets business, and we're going to go from $170 billion of client AUM with GIP to call it $285 of client AUM, as we grow our private markets business, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue. We'd expect to see positive leverage to average fee rates and organic growth over time. Going into Q4 ex-GIP, we'd expect the entry rate to be flat. And as I noted, consolidation of the GIP portfolios into our business is expected to lift the fee rate by about a 0.5 to 1 full basis point. So in the longer term, as we see a liquids and private markets as a bigger contributor to our business mix, we would expect that to have positive leverage on the fee rate.\\n\\nOperator: We'll go next to Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\\n\\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Happy anniversary. I think I was there at the beginning. Sad to say. Indeed, I remember that meeting like it was yesterday. So question for you, I was very intrigued by your statement about revolutionizing the wealth management opportunity. I was wondering if you could maybe unpack that a little bit. I think you mentioned that the whole portfolio opportunity could be better than everything on the evergreen side to date. And just wondering if you could expand your thinking a little bit just so we get a sense of the magnitude and the opportunity and maybe any go-to-market strategy we should be thinking about as we look into the new year? Thank you.\\n\\nMartin S. Small: Thank you. Thanks, Bill, very much. Very much appreciate the question. So we have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. Our aims to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private markets exposures. I think if you go back to the last several investor days we've had, we've talked about building the portfolio of the future for wealth managers, which is digitally enabled, it's public-private, and this market, I think, is still very early. Retail allocation to private markets still remains in low single digits. Just on capabilities for us here, we have a great established leading franchise in retail liquid alternatives. We've got over $40 billion of assets here across merger [ARB] (ph), systematic multi-strategy commodity exposures. We've had a lot of success in bringing retail [alts] (ph) to retirement in the UK and Europe through the LTIF and LTAP for structures. We've been building out our evergreen and credit integral funds here in the United States. We have a credit strategies integral fund [CredEx] (ph). We have a non-traded credit BDC [BDET] (ph), which are combined to be over a $1 billion today. BDET's well placed for RIAs, independent broker dealers, offshore wealth. We think this can be a strong grower for us. But as you said, longer term, our aspiration is to integrate semi-liquid products into our over $300 billion of managed models and SMAs. That would be the most significant unlock and we feel competitive advantage we have. It's at the heart of the models venture that we've entered into with Partners Group. But I'd say, it's consistently, it's part of the partnerships we have with InvestNet, with GOL, with iCapital, with Case, with Vesmark. Our goal is to make model portfolios seamless in terms of public-private in the same way we've been able to do that with ETF and mutual fund active model portfolios. So we have a lot more work to do on that, but we're excited about the opportunity.\\n\\nLaurence D. Fink: Bill, let me add more to that answer. As we believed when we acquired BGI that ETS would become the instrument of so much of the activity in the capital market that it's really been that way. Even in 2012 when we said ETS are going to be expanding heavily in fixed income to the surprise of so many people and we crossed $1 trillion from that. What we are seeing now in private markets of blending of public and private and that's going to continue to blend. Institutional clients are going to be looking at measurements of liquidity, and they're going to be trading in between public and private. That will become the new domain. And so, we're not going to look at private markets in the same way. Like we're not going to say there are alternatives. They're just part of the marketplace itself. And one of the reasons why we were so driven to acquire Preqin, we believe that data and analytics will accelerate that movement of making public and private ubiquitous together and what we're going to look at is liquidity as the driver of risk. And so, we're going to be blending liquidity from the public markets, the liquidity of the private markets and making risk assessments. And if through the data analytics that we could have combining Preqin, Aladdin and eFront, if we could build that platform into more transparency in privates, more opportunities for privates, this idea of the blending in public and privates will become a reality, just like the reality of how ETFs became the driving force of so many of the markets now, and we believe that will happen too, but it's going to happen with the acceleration of data and analytics. So when you think about these retail platforms that will be driving more private type of exposures, it will accelerate only when we have better data analytics transparency indexing and that is a major component of our strategy going forward.\\n\\nBen Budish: Good morning and thank you for having me on the call. I wanted to ask about your ambitions in digital assets to maybe change it up a little bit. It seems like one way or another we're going to have a new president next year who's going to be more friendly to the industry. And while it could take some time to see new rules and regulations, I'm just wondering, what do you see as the key opportunities for BlackRock that this change in posture from Washington could unlock sort of beyond the ETF business and some of the other custody things you do? Thank you.\\n\\nLaurence D. Fink: Well, first, I'm not sure if either president or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of digital assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide. Conversations we're having with institutions worldwide, conversations about how should they think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be. We believe Bitcoin is asset class in itself, it is an alternative to other commodities like gold. And so I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Two, the role of Ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded. But I truly don't believe it's a function of regulation, of more regulation, less regulation. I think it's a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you -- years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high yield market occurred, started off very slow, but it built as we build better analytics and data and then through better analytics and data, more acceptance and a broadening of the market. And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets. And then we'll see how does each and every country look at their own digital currency. That's a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself. But I do believe what we're going to witness as we build out better analytics. And then the question is, as you mentioned, regulation. How do we see in this country the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play? That's a very different question related to, let's say, Bitcoin and other items like that. But all of that is going to be under discussion. And what we're witnessing in other countries that we're seeing big success in India and Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons. But we believe the technology of these blockchains are going to become very additive. And then it will overlay AI and having better data analytics. The applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur.\\n\\nBrennan Hawken: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious whether you all have seen any changes in the RFP activity on the fixed income side. There's recently been some regulatory issues at a large institutional bond manager. So kind of curious about what you're seeing in the market there on the back of that?\\n\\nLaurence D. Fink: So if you look at our announcement this quarter, we announced we won a $30 billion mandate from a pension fund. It is not uncommon to see big, large changes in the marketplace. I don't want to talk about one client or another client or what's happening with one manager versus another manager. There is no question, money is in motion. Rob Capito talks about this a lot. We are seeing this. There's a very large institutional mandate that are going to be up for -- there's an RFP right now. And so, I don't look at this as any different. Obviously there are some issues around that are in the press, but money in motion occurs every quarter. There are large opportunities every quarter. And I think one thing that we see consistently as OCIO mandates occur, they're occurring with more regularity and with more opportunity. And this is away from the topic that you brought up. But it's important to just note this is not uncommon seeing large blocks of business moving around. And I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nOperator: At this time, this does concludes today's Q&A session. And I'd like to turn the call back to Larry Fink for any additional or closing remarks.\\n\\nLaurence D. Fink: Thank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock over these last 25 years. Our third quarter results are possible because of the global network of relationships we've created, our data analytics that are differentiated by all imagination, and importantly our integrated technology that we built over many, many years. We have a long history of good integration, whether it is integration of BGI, Malim, Aperio, eFront, and now we're working on a successful close and integration of GIP. And we expect the same thing of a closing and integration of Preqin around year end. And I believe our position has never been better. And I believe as we look forward in delivering strong performance for our clients, we will create differentiated growth for you, our shareholders, in the coming years ahead. Everybody, thank you and have a nice and positive quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye.\\n\\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

The Notes will have the terms described in this document and the accompanying prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement. If the terms of the Notes offered hereby are inconsistent with those described in the accompanying prospectus, prospectus supplement or Equity Index Underlying Supplement, the terms described in this document shall control.\\n\\nThis document relates to an offering of Notes linked to the performance of the Reference Asset. The purchaser of a Note will acquire a senior unsecured debt security of HSBC USA Inc. linked to the Reference Asset as described below. The following key terms relate to the offering of the Notes:\\n\\nGENERAL\\n\\nThis document relates to an offering of Notes linked to the Reference Asset. The purchaser of a Note will acquire a senior unsecured debt security of HSBC USA Inc. Although the offering of Notes relates to the Reference Asset, you should not construe that fact as a recommendation as to the merits of acquiring an investment linked to the Reference Asset or any security included in the Reference Asset or as to the suitability of an investment in the Notes.\\n\\nYou should read this document together with the prospectus dated February 21, 2024, the prospectus supplement dated February 21, 2024, and Equity Index Underlying Supplement dated February 21, 2024. If the terms of the Notes offered hereby are inconsistent with those described in the accompanying prospectus, prospectus supplement or Equity Index Underlying Supplement, the terms described in this document shall control. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in \\\"Risk Factors\\\" beginning on page PS-5 of this document, page S-1 of the prospectus supplement and page S-1 of the Equity Index Underlying Supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. As used herein, references to the \\\"Issuer\\\", \\\"HSBC\\\", \\\"we\\\", \\\"us\\\" and \\\"our\\\" are to HSBC USA Inc.\\n\\nHSBC has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement) with the SEC for the offering to which this document relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement in that registration statement and other documents HSBC has filed with the SEC for more complete information about HSBC and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. or any dealer participating in this offering will arrange to send you the prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement if you request them by calling toll-free 1-866-811-8049.\\n\\nOn the Maturity Date, for each Note you hold, we will pay you the Final Settlement Value, which is an amount in cash, as described below:\\n\\nIf the Reference Return is greater than or equal to zero, you will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date, per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:\\n\\n$1,000 + ($1,000 \\u00d7 Reference Return \\u00d7 Upside Participation Rate).\\n\\nIf the Reference Return is less than zero but greater than or equal to the Buffer Percentage, you will receive $1,000 per $1,000 Principal Amount (zero return).\\n\\nIf the Reference Return is less than the Buffer Percentage, you will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date, per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:\\n\\n$1,000 + [$1,000 \\u00d7 (Reference Return + 30.00%)].\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, you will lose 1% of the Principal Amount of your Notes for each percentage point that the Reference Return is below the Buffer Percentage. For example, if the Reference Return is -40.00%, you will suffer a 10% loss and receive 90% of the Principal Amount, subject to the credit risk of HSBC. You should be aware that if the Reference Return is less than the Buffer Percentage, you will lose some or a significant portion (up to 70.00%) of your investment.\\n\\nWe or one of our affiliates will act as calculation agent with respect to the Notes.\\n\\nReference Sponsor\\n\\nThe reference sponsor of the SPXFP is S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (\\\"S&P\\\").\\n\\nWe urge you to read the section \\\"Risk Factors\\\" beginning on page S-1 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page S-1 of the accompanying Equity Index Underlying Supplement. You should understand the risks of investing in the Notes and should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration, with your advisors, of the suitability of the Notes in light of your particular financial circumstances and the information set forth in this document and the accompanying prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement.\\n\\nIn addition to the risks discussed below, you should review \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in the accompanying prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement including the explanation of risks relating to the Notes described in the following sections:\\n\\nYou will be subject to significant risks not associated with conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt securities.\\n\\nRisks Relating to the Structure or Features of the Notes\\n\\nThe amount payable on the Notes is not linked to the value of the Reference Asset at any time other than on the Final Valuation Date.\\n\\nThe Final Value will be based on the Official Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Final Valuation Date, subject to postponement for non-trading days and certain Market Disruption Events. Even if the value of the Reference Asset appreciates during the term of the Notes other than on the Final Valuation Date but then decreases on the Final Valuation Date to a value that is less than the Initial Value, the Payment at Maturity may be less, and may be significantly less, than it would have been had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the value of the Reference Asset prior to such decrease. Although the actual value of the Reference Asset on the Maturity Date or at other times during the term of the Notes may be higher than the Final Value, the Payment at Maturity will be based solely on the Official Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Final Valuation Date.\\n\\nYour investment in the Notes may result in a loss.\\n\\nYou will be exposed to the decline in the Final Value from the Initial Value beyond the Buffer Percentage. Accordingly, if the Reference Return is less than the Buffer Percentage, your Payment at Maturity will be less than the Principal Amount of your Notes. You will lose some or a significant portion (up to 70.00%) of your investment at maturity if the Reference Return is less than the Buffer Percentage.\\n\\nThe Notes will not bear interest.\\n\\nAs a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments.\\n\\nRisks Relating to the Reference Asset\\n\\nChanges that affect the value of the Reference Asset may affect the market value of the Notes and the amount you will receive on the Notes and the amount you will receive at maturity.\\n\\nThe policies of the reference sponsor of the Reference Asset concerning additions, deletions and substitutions of the stocks included in the Reference Asset, and the manner in which the reference sponsor takes account of certain changes affecting those stocks, may affect the value of the Reference Asset. The policies of the reference sponsor with respect to the calculation of the Reference Asset could also affect the value of the Reference Asset. The reference sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or dissemination of the Reference Asset. Any such actions could affect the value of the Reference Asset and the value of and the return on the Notes.\\n\\nThe Reference Asset is subject to significant risks associated with the futures contract to which the Reference Asset is linked.\\n\\nThe Reference Asset is linked to the next maturing E-mini S&P 500 futures contract currently listed for trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the \\\"CME\\\"). The price of this futures contract depends not only on the level of the S&P 500 Index, which is the underlying index referenced by the futures contract, but also on a range of other factors, including but not limited to the performance and volatility of the U.S. stock market, corporate earnings reports, geopolitical events, governmental and regulatory policies and the policies of the CME. In addition, the futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including the lack of liquidity in the markets, the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention. These factors and others can cause the prices of the underlying futures contract to be volatile and could adversely affect the level of the Reference Asset and any payments on, and the value of, your Notes.\\n\\nHigher future prices of the futures contract to which the Reference Asset is linked relative to its current prices may adversely affect the value of the Reference Asset and the value of the Notes.\\n\\nThe Reference Asset is linked to the next maturing E-mini S&P 500 futures contract currently listed for trading on the CME. As the relevant futures contract approaches expiration, it is replaced by a contract that has a later expiration. Thus, for example, a contract purchased and held in September may specify a December expiration. As time passes, the contract expiring in December is replaced by a contract for delivery in March. This process is referred to as \\\"rolling.\\\" If the market for these contracts is (putting aside other considerations) in \\\"backwardation,\\\" where the prices are lower in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months, the sale of the December contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price of the March contract, thereby creating a \\\"roll yield.\\\" While many futures contracts have historically exhibited consistent periods of backwardation, backwardation will most likely not exist at all times. It is also possible for the market for these contracts to be in \\\"contango.\\\" Contango markets are those in which the prices of contracts are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months. The presence of contango and absence of backwardation in the market for these contracts could result in negative \\\"roll yields,\\\" which could adversely affect the value of the Reference Asset, and, accordingly, the value of the Notes.\\n\\nLinking to an equity futures contract is different from linking to the equity index tracked by the equity futures contract.\\n\\nThe return on your Notes will be related to the performance of an equity futures contract and not the equity index tracked by the equity futures contract. On a given day, a \\\"futures price\\\" is the price at which market participants may agree to buy or sell the asset underlying a futures contract in the future, and the \\\"spot price\\\" is the current price of such underlying asset for immediate delivery. A variety of factors can lead to a disparity between the price of a futures contract at a given point in time and the spot price of its underlying asset, such as the expected dividend yields of any stocks that comprise such underlying asset, the implicit financing cost associated with the futures contract and market expectations related to the future price of the futures contract's underlying asset. Purchasing an equity futures contract is similar to borrowing money to buy the underlying asset of such futures contract because it enables an investor to gain exposure to such underlying asset without having to pay the full cost of such exposure up front, and therefore entails a financing cost. As a result, the Reference Asset is expected to reflect not only the performance of the S&P 500\\u00ae Index, but also the implicit financing cost in the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract, among other factors. Such implicit financing cost will adversely affect the level of the Reference Asset. Any increase in market interest rates will be expected to further increase this implicit financing cost and will have an adverse effect on the level of the Reference Asset and, therefore, the value of and return on the Notes. The price movement of a futures contract is typically correlated with the movements of the price of its underlying asset, but the correlation is generally imperfect, and price movements in the spot market may not be reflected in the futures market (and vice versa). Accordingly, your Notes may underperform a similar investment that more directly reflects the return on the S&P 500\\u00ae Index.\\n\\nSuspension or disruptions of market trading in futures markets may adversely affect the value of the Notes.\\n\\nSecurities markets and futures markets are subject to disruptions due to various factors, including the lack of liquidity in the markets, the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention. In addition, U.S. futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day. These limits are generally referred to as \\\"daily price fluctuation limits,\\\" and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a \\\"limit price.\\\" Once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made at a different price. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at disadvantageous times or prices. Any such disruption could have an adverse effect on the value of the Reference Asset or the manner in which it is calculated, and therefore, the value of the Notes.\\n\\nLegal and regulatory changes could adversely affect the return on and value of your Notes.\\n\\nFutures contracts and options on futures contracts, including those related to the Reference Asset, are subject to extensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, commonly referred to as the \\\"CFTC,\\\" and the exchanges on which such futures contracts trade, are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily limits and the suspension of trading. Furthermore, certain exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuations in futures contract prices that may occur during a single five-minute trading period. These limits could adversely affect the market prices of relevant futures and options contracts and forward contracts.\\n\\nThe Notes are linked to an excess return index and not a total return index\\n\\nThe Notes are linked to an excess return index and not a total return index. An excess return index, such as the Reference Asset, reflects the returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the contracts composing that index. By contrast, a \\\"total return\\\" index, in addition to reflecting those returns, also reflects interest that could be earned on funds committed to the trading of the underlying futures contracts.\\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors\\n\\nThe Notes are subject to the credit risk of HSBC USA Inc.\\n\\nThe Notes are senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer, HSBC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. As further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus, the Notes will rank on par with all of the other unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of HSBC, except such obligations as may be preferred by operation of law. Any\\n\\npayment to be made on the Notes, including any return of principal at maturity, depends on the ability of HSBC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of HSBC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event HSBC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.\\n\\nThe Notes are not insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency of the United States or any other jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe Notes are not deposit liabilities or other obligations of a bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or program of the United States or any other jurisdiction. An investment in the Notes is subject to the credit risk of HSBC, and in the event that HSBC is unable to pay its obligations as they become due, you may not receive the full payments due on the Notes.\\n\\nThe Estimated Initial Value of the Notes, which was determined by us on the Trade Date, is less than the price to public and may differ from the market value of the Notes in the secondary market, if any.\\n\\nThe Estimated Initial Value of the Notes was calculated by us on the Trade Date and is less than the price to public. The Estimated Initial Value reflects our and our affiliates' internal funding rate, which is the borrowing rate paid to issue market-linked securities, as well as the mid-market value of the embedded derivatives in the Notes. This internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. As a result of the difference between our internal funding rate and the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities, the Estimated Initial Value of the Notes may be lower if it were based on the prices at which our fixed or floating rate debt securities trade in the secondary market. In addition, if we were to use the rate we use for our conventional fixed or floating rate debt issuances, we would expect the economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you. We determined the value of the embedded derivatives in the Notes by reference to our or our affiliates' internal pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, which can include volatility and interest rates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the Notes that are different from our Estimated Initial Value. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. The Estimated Initial Value does not represent a minimum price at which we or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time.\\n\\nThe price of your Notes in the secondary market, if any, immediately after the Trade Date is expected to be less than the price to public.\\n\\nThe price to public takes into account certain costs. These costs include our affiliates' projected hedging profits (which may or may not be realized) for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the Notes, the underwriting discount and the costs associated with structuring and hedging our obligations under the Notes. These costs will be used or retained by us or one of our affiliates, except for underwriting discounts paid to unaffiliated distributors. If you were to sell your Notes in the secondary market, if any, the price you would receive for your Notes may be less than the price you paid for them because secondary market prices will not take into account these costs. The price of your Notes in the secondary market, if any, at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors, including the value of the Reference Asset and changes in market conditions, and cannot be predicted with accuracy. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments, and you should, therefore, be able and willing to hold the Notes to maturity. Any sale of the Notes prior to maturity could result in a loss to you.\\n\\nIf we were to repurchase your Notes immediately after the Original Issue Date, the price you receive may be higher than the Estimated Initial Value of the Notes.\\n\\nAssuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Original Issue Date, the price at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that may initially be used for customer account statements, if any, may exceed the Estimated Initial Value on the Trade Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 6 months after the Original Issue Date. This temporary price difference may exist because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We will make such discretionary election and determine this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, including the tenor of the Notes and any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the Original Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.\\n\\nYou will not have any ownership interest in the stocks included in the Reference Asset.\\n\\nAs a holder of the Notes, you will not have any ownership interest in the stocks included in the Reference Asset, such as rights to vote, dividend payments or other distributions. Because the return on the Notes will not reflect any dividends on those stocks, the Notes may underperform an investment in the stocks included in the Reference Asset.\\n\\nThe Notes lack liquidity.\\n\\nThe Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is not required to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market, if any exists. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough\\n\\nliquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is willing to buy the Notes.\\n\\nPotential conflicts of interest may exist.\\n\\nAn affiliate of HSBC has a minority equity interest in the owner of an electronic platform, through which we may make available certain structured investments offering materials. HSBC and its affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, including acting as calculation agent and hedging our obligations under the Notes. In performing these duties, the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. We will not have any obligation to consider your interests as a holder of the Notes in taking any action that might affect the value of your Notes.\\n\\nUncertain tax treatment.\\n\\nFor a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in a Note, please see the discussion under \\\"U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\\\" herein and the discussion under \\\"U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\\\" in the accompanying prospectus supplement.\\n\\nILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES\\n\\nThe following table and examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are hypothetical. They do not purport to be representative of every possible scenario concerning increases or decreases in the value of the Reference Asset relative to its Initial Value. We cannot predict the Final Value. The assumptions we have made in connection with the illustrations set forth below may not reflect actual events, and the hypothetical Initial Value used in the table and examples below is not expected to be the actual Initial Value of the Reference Asset. You should not take this illustration or these examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Reference Asset or the return on your Notes. The Final Settlement Value may be less than the amount that you would have received from a conventional debt security with the same stated maturity, including such a security issued by HSBC. The numbers appearing in the table below and following examples have been rounded for ease of analysis.\\n\\nThe table below illustrates the Payment at Maturity on a $1,000 investment in the Notes for a hypothetical range of Reference Returns from -100% to +100%. The following results are based solely on the assumptions outlined below. The \\\"Hypothetical Return on the Notes\\\" as used below is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the Final Settlement Value per $1,000 Principal Amount to $1,000. The potential returns described here assume that your Notes are held to maturity. You should consider carefully whether the Notes are suitable to your investment goals. The following table and examples assume the following:\\n\\nThe hypothetical Initial Value of 1,000.00 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual Initial Value of the Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value of the Reference Asset is set forth on page PS- of this document.\\n\\nThe following examples indicate how the Final Settlement Value would be calculated with respect to a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the Notes.\\n\\nExample 1: The value of the Reference Asset increases from the Initial Value of 1,000.00 to a Final Value of 1,150.00.\\n\\nBecause the Reference Return is positive, the Final Settlement Value would be $1,216.000 per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:\\n\\nExample 1 shows that you will receive the return of your principal investment plus a return equal to the Reference Return multiplied by the Upside Participation Rate of 144.00% when the Reference Asset appreciates.\\n\\nExample 2: The value of the Reference Asset decreases from the Initial Value of 1,000.00 to a Final Value of 850.00.\\n\\nBecause the Reference Return is less than zero but greater than the Buffer Percentage of -30.00%, the Final Settlement Value would be $1,000.000 per $1,000 Principal Amount (a zero return).\\n\\nExample 3: The value of the Reference Asset decreases from the Initial Value of 1,000.00 to a Final Value of 550.00.\\n\\nBecause the Reference Return is less than the Buffer Percentage of -30.00%, the Final Settlement Value would be $850.000 per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:\\n\\nExample 3 shows that you are exposed on a 1-to-1 basis to declines in the value of the Reference Asset beyond the Buffer Percentage of -30.00%. You will lose some or a significant portion (up to 70.00%) of your investment.\\n\\nAs each Underlying Futures Contract approaches maturity, it is replaced by the next maturing Underlying Futures Contract in a process referred to as \\\"rolling.\\\" The rolling of the SPXFP occurs quarterly over a one-day rolling period (the \\\"roll day\\\") every March, June, September and December, effective after the close of trading five business days preceding the last trading date of the maturing Underlying Futures Contract.\\n\\nOn any scheduled roll day, the occurrence of either of the following circumstances will result in an adjustment of the roll day according to the procedure set forth in this section:\\n\\n\\u00b7\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202fAn exchange holiday occurs on that scheduled roll day.\\n\\n\\u00b7\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202fThe daily contract price of any Underlying Futures Contract within the SPXFP on that scheduled roll day is a limit price.\\n\\nIf either of the above events occur, the relevant roll day will take place on the next designated commodity index business day whereby none of the circumstances identified take place.\\n\\nIf a disruption is approaching the last trading day of a contract expiration, the Index Committee (defined below) will convene to determine the appropriate course of action, which may include guidance from the CME.\\n\\nThe Index Committee may change the date of a given rebalancing for reasons including market holidays occurring on or around the scheduled rebalancing date. Any such change will be announced with proper advance notice where possible.\\n\\nIndex Calculations\\n\\nThe closing level of the SPXFP on any trading day reflects the change in the daily contract price of the Underlying Futures Contract since the immediately preceding trading day. On each quarterly roll day, the closing level of the SPXFP reflects the change from the daily contract price of the maturing Underlying Futures Contract on the immediately preceding trading day to the daily contract price of the next maturing Underlying Futures Contract on that roll day.\\n\\nThe daily contract price of an Underlying Futures Contract will be the settlement price reported by the CME. If the CME fails to open due to unforeseen circumstances, such as natural disasters, inclement weather, outages, or other events, the SPXFP uses the prior daily contract prices. In situations where the CME is forced to close early due to unforeseen events, such as computer or electric power failures, weather conditions or other events, the Index Sponsor calculates the closing level of the SPXFP based on (1) the daily contract prices published by the CME, or (2) if no daily contract prices is available, the Index Committee determines the course of action and notifies clients accordingly.\\n\\nIndex Governance\\n\\nAn S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC index committee (the \\\"Index Committee\\\") maintains the SPXFP. All committee members are full-time professional members of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC's staff. The Index Committee may revise index policy covering rules for including currencies, the timing of rebalancing or other matters. The Index Committee considers information about changes to the SPXFP and related matters to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all Index Committee discussions are confidential.\\n\\nThe Index Committees reserve the right to make exceptions when applying the methodology of the SPXFP if the need arises.\\n\\nIn addition to the daily governance of the SPXFP and maintenance of its index methodology, at least once within any 12-month period, the Index\\n\\nCommittee reviews the methodology to ensure the SPXFP continues to achieve the stated objectives, and that the data and methodology remain effective. In certain instances, the Index Sponsor may publish a consultation inviting comments from external parties.\\n\\nFutures contracts are traded on regulated futures exchanges, in the over-the-counter market and on various types of electronic trading facilities and markets. As of the date of this term sheet, the futures contract represented by the SPXFP is an exchange-traded futures contract. A futures contract provides for a specified settlement month in which the cash settlement is made by the seller (whose position is therefore described as \\\"short\\\") and acquired by the purchaser (whose position is therefore described as \\\"long\\\").\\n\\nNo purchase price is paid or received on the purchase or sale of a futures contract. Instead, an amount of cash or cash equivalents must be deposited with the broker as \\\"initial margin.\\\" This amount varies based on the requirements imposed by the exchange clearing houses, but it may be lower than 5% of the notional value of the contract. This margin deposit provides collateral for the obligations of the parties to the futures contract.\\n\\nBy depositing margin, which may vary in form depending on the exchange, with the clearing house or broker involved, a market\\n\\nparticipant may be able to earn interest on its margin funds, thereby increasing the total return that it may realize from an investment in futures contracts.\\n\\nAt any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, a trader may elect to close out its position by taking an opposite position on the exchange on which the trader obtained the position, subject to the availability of a liquid secondary market. This operates to terminate the position and fix the trader's profit or loss. Futures contracts are cleared through the facilities of a centralized clearing house and a brokerage firm that is a member of the clearing house. Futures exchanges may adopt rules and take other actions that affect trading, including imposing speculative position limits, maximum price fluctuations and trading halts and suspensions and requiring liquidation of contracts in certain circumstances.\\n\\nThe Underlying Futures Contracts\\n\\nThe Underlying Futures Contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated futures contracts which are based on the SPX and traded on the CME that represent a contract unit of $50 multiplied by the SPX, measured in cents per index point. The Underlying Futures Contracts listed for the nearest nine quarters, for each March, June, September and December, and the nearest three Decembers, are available for trading. Trading of the Underlying Futures Contracts terminates at 9:30 A.M. Eastern time on the third Friday of the contract month. The daily settlement prices of the Underlying Futures Contracts are based on trading activity in the relevant contract (and in the case of a lead month also being the expiry month, together with trading activity on lead month-second month spread contracts) on the CME during a specified settlement period. The final settlement price of Underlying Futures Contracts is based on the opening prices of the component stocks in the SPX, determined on the third Friday of the contract month\\n\\nThe Reference Index Sponsor of the SPXFP is S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (\\\"S&P\\\")\\n\\nThe S&P 500 Index\\n\\nThe S&P 500 Index (\\\"SPX\\\") is a market capitalization-weighted index intended to provide a performance benchmark for the large-cap U.S. equity markets. The SPX includes a representative sample of 500 companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy.\\n\\nFor more information about the SPX, see \\\"The S&P 500 Index\\\" beginning on page S-54 of the accompanying Equity Index Underlying Supplement.\\n\\nLicense Agreement\\n\\nHSBC has entered into a nonexclusive license agreement providing for the license to it, in exchange for a fee, of the right to use indices owned and published by S&P in connection with some products, including the Notes. The SPXFP is a product of S&P, and has been licensed for use by HSBC. The Notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by S&P Dow Jones Indices. S&P makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the owners of the Notes or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in securities generally or in the Notes particularly or the ability of the SPXFP to track general market performance. S&P's only relationship to HSBC is the licensing of the SPXFP and certain trademarks, service marks and/or trade names of S&P. The SPXFP is determined, composed and calculated by S&P without regard to HSBC or the Notes. S&P has no obligation to take the needs of HSBC or the owners of the Notes into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the SPXFP. S&P is not responsible for and has not participated in the determination of the prices and amount of the Notes or the timing of the issuance or sale of the Notes or in the determination or calculation of the equation by which the Notes are to be converted into cash. S&P has no obligation or liability in connection with the administration, marketing or trading of the Notes. There is no assurance that investment products based on the SPXFP will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns. S&P is not an investment advisor. Inclusion of a security within the SPXFP is not a recommendation by S&P to buy, sell or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.\\n\\nS&P DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ADEQUACY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE SPXFP OR ANY DATA RELATED THERETO OR ANY COMMUNICATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ORAL OR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION (INCLUDING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS) WITH RESPECT THERETO. S&P SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR DELAYS THEREIN. S&P MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OR AS TO RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY HSBC, OWNERS OF THE NOTES, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FROM THE USE OF THE SPXFP OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY DATA RELATED THERETO. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT WHATSOEVER SHALL S&P BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, TRADING LOSSES, LOST TIME OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. THERE ARE NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF ANY AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN S&P AND HSBC, OTHER THAN THE LICENSORS OF S&P.\\n\\nHistorical Performance of the SPXFP\\n\\nThe following graph sets forth the historical performance of the SPXFP based on the daily historical closing values from October 9, 2014 through October 9, 2024. We obtained the closing values below from the Bloomberg Professional\\u00ae service. We have not undertaken any independent review of, or made any due diligence inquiry with respect to, the information obtained from the Bloomberg Professional service.\\n\\nThe historical values of the SPXFP should not be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Official Closing Level of the SPXFP on the Final Valuation Date.\\n\\nEVENTS OF DEFAULT AND ACCELERATION\\n\\nIf the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an Event of Default (as defined in the accompanying prospectus) with respect to the Notes, the calculation agent will determine the accelerated payment due and payable in the same general manner as described in this document except that in such a case, the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the date of acceleration will be used as the Final Valuation Date for purposes of determining the Reference Return of the Reference Asset, and the accelerated Maturity Date will be three business days after the accelerated Final Valuation Date. If a Market Disruption Event exists with respect to the Reference Asset on that scheduled trading day, then the accelerated Final Valuation Date for the Reference Asset will be postponed for up to five scheduled trading days (in the same manner used for postponing the originally scheduled Final Valuation Date). The accelerated Maturity Date will also be postponed by an equal number of business days.\\n\\nIf the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an Event of Default, you will not be entitled to any additional payments with respect to the Notes. For more information, see \\\"Description of Debt Securities -- Senior Debt Securities -- Events of Default\\\" in the accompanying prospectus.\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\\n\\nWe have appointed HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., an affiliate of HSBC, as the agent for the sale of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. will purchase the Notes from HSBC at the price to public less the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement for distribution to other registered broker-dealers or will offer the Notes directly to investors. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. has offered the Notes at the price to public set forth on the cover page of this document. HSBC USA Inc. or one of our affiliates may pay varying underwriting discounts of up to 0.25% per $1,000 Principal Amount in connection with the distribution of the Notes to other registered broker-dealers.\\n\\nAn affiliate of HSBC has paid or may pay in the future an amount to broker-dealers in connection with the costs of the continuing implementation of systems to support the Notes. We or one of our affiliates may pay a fee to one or more broker dealers for providing certain services with respect to this offering, which may reduce the economic terms of the notes to you.\\n\\nIn addition, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. or another of its affiliates or agents may use this pricing supplement in market-making transactions after the initial sale of the Notes, but is under no obligation to make a market in the Notes and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice.\\n\\nSee \\\"Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)\\\" on page S-87 in the prospectus supplement.\\n\\nDelivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on the Original Issue Date set forth on the inside cover page of this document, which is more than one business day following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than one business day prior to the Original Issue Date will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement, and should consult their own advisors.\\n\\nU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nThere is no direct legal authority as to the proper tax treatment of the Notes, and therefore significant aspects of the tax treatment of the\\n\\nNotes are uncertain as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Under one approach, a Note should be treated as a pre-paid executory contract with respect to the Reference Asset. We intend to treat the Notes consistent with this approach. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, you agree to treat the Notes under this approach for all U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the limitations described therein, and based on certain factual representations received from us, in the opinion of our special U.S. tax counsel, Mayer Brown LLP, it is reasonable to treat a Note as a pre-paid executory contract with respect to the Reference Asset. Pursuant to this approach we do not intend to report any income or gain with respect to the Notes prior to their maturity or an earlier sale or exchange and we intend to treat any gain or loss upon maturity or an earlier sale or exchange as long-term capital gain or loss, provided that you have held the Note for more than one year at such time for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\\n\\nWe will not attempt to ascertain whether any of the entities whose stock is included in the Reference Asset would be treated as a passive foreign investment company (\\\"PFIC\\\") or United States real property holding corporation (\\\"USRPHC\\\"), both as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If one or more of the entities whose stock is included in the Reference Asset were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences might apply. You should refer to information filed with the SEC and other authorities by the entities whose stock is included in the Reference Asset and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you if one or more of the entities whose stock is included in the Reference Asset is or becomes a PFIC or a USRPHC.\\n\\nUnder current law, while the matter is not entirely clear, individual non-U.S. holders, and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals' gross estates for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example, a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual has retained certain interests or powers), should note that, absent an applicable treaty benefit, the Notes are likely to be treated as U.S. situs property, subject to U.S. federal estate tax. These individuals and entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of investing in the Notes.\\n\\nA \\\"dividend equivalent\\\" payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations, payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (\\\"ELIs\\\") that are \\\"specified ELIs\\\" may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an \\\"underlying security,\\\" which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However, Internal Revenue Service guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1, 2027. Based on the Issuer's determination that the Notes are not \\\"delta-one\\\" instruments, non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments, if any, under the Notes. However, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Asset or the Notes, and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter, or have entered, into other transactions in respect of the Reference Asset or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding, we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.\\n\\nFor a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in a Note, please see the discussion under \\\"U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\\\" in the accompanying prospectus supplement.\\n\\nPROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES.\\n\\nVALIDITY OF THE NOTES\\n\\nIn the opinion of Mayer Brown LLP, as counsel to the Issuer, when this pricing supplement has been attached to, and duly notated on, the master note that represents the Notes pursuant to the Senior Indenture referred to in the prospectus supplement dated February 21, 2024, and issued and paid for as contemplated herein, the Notes offered by this pricing supplement will be valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Issuer, entitled to the benefits of the Senior Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith). This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the Maryland General Corporation Law (including the statutory provisions, all applicable provisions of the Maryland Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing) and the federal laws of the United States of America. This opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee's authorization, execution and delivery of the Senior Indenture and the genuineness of signatures and to such counsel's reliance on the Issuer and other sources as to certain factual matters, all as stated in the legal opinion dated February 21, 2024, which has been filed as Exhibit 5.3 to the Issuer's registration statement on Form S-3 dated February 21, 2024.\",\n",

      "    \"title\": \"BlackRock (BLK) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\",\n",
      "    \"body\": \"Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. third quarter 2024 earnings teleconference.\\n\\nOur host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer Martin S. Small, President Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel Christopher J.\\n\\nMeade. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\\n\\nChristopher J. Meade -- General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer\\n\\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the general counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.\\n\\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \\\"Double Down\\\" stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\\n\\nRight now, we're issuing \\\"Double Down\\\" alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\\n\\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results.\\n\\nOur earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. On our previous earnings call, we spoke to improving client sentiment and steadily improving organic growth. We sounded optimism about our growth trajectory in the second half of the year.\\n\\nAnd in the third quarter, organic growth surged, and BlackRock delivered some of the best financial results in our history. We generated $221 billion of net inflows, our highest net flows quarter ever. We delivered record levels of quarterly revenue and operating income. We expanded our margin by 350 basis points year over year.\\n\\nWe generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest quarter in three years. Organic growth is accelerating as we execute on a strong pipeline, and clients turn to BlackRock to move in size into public and private markets. Our structural growers, iShares; whole portfolio outsourcing, Aladdin, the structural growers all delivered strong third quarter growth and are poised to accelerate into year end. iShares.\\n\\niShares is leading the industry in global flows with approximately $250 billion through the third quarter and historically sees upwards of 40% of its total annual flows in Q4. Fixed-income ETFs, built cheaply on organic growth. iShares' fixed-income ETF assets now stand at over $1 trillion, nearly 40% higher than at year-end 2021. And Aladdin.\\n\\nAladdin logs 15% ACV growth, consistent with our long-term low to mid-teens target with excellent momentum and key wins with growing clients. Finally, fixed income. Fixed income delivered across the platform with over $60 billion of net inflows. We believe the continued path of central bank normalization will support sustained inflows across bond funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts.\\n\\nFixed income remains a compelling organic growth opportunity for BlackRock. Private markets are a strategic priority for BlackRock, delivering world-class private markets capabilities to more deeply serve clients across the whole portfolio. On October 1, we closed on our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. The combination triples infrastructure AUM and doubles private markets run-rate management fees.\\n\\nWe're already seeing the power of BlackRock and GIP together. Our partnership with Microsoft and MGX. It aims to realize the enormous investment potential of infrastructure to support AI innovation, and it's just the first proof point of the growth synergies we can create together. We're bringing private markets to wealth clients.\\n\\nBlackRock manages more than $300 billion of assets across model portfolios and separately managed accounts for wealth managers. These portfolios would benefit from increased exposure and more efficient access to the private markets. We believe the model portfolio solution we're building with Partners Group will revolutionize access to private markets for wealth managers and improve portfolio outcomes for millions of households on an even bigger scale than what's been done with evergreen funds. And as long observed in markets, information about capital has become almost as important as capital itself.\\n\\nOur planned acquisition of Preqin is accelerating this exciting private markets data and analytics journey for BlackRock and our clients. Our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients through access to unique opportunities, expertise, and world-class client service. We're also moving swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to continue to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. We're building our mix toward higher secular growth areas, like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates, and model portfolios.\\n\\nWe believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater diversification, and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Successful execution of these goals should also result in multiple expansion for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with AUM near $11.5 trillion, 11.5 trillion units of trust clients building with BlackRock. Our business tends to be seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and we maintain line of sight into a broad, global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel organic growth.\\n\\nBlackRock generated total net inflows of $221 billion in the third quarter, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth. Third quarter revenue of $5.2 billion was 15% higher year over year, driven by 5% organic base fee growth, the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months, and alpha generation in our liquid alternative strategies. Operating income of $2.1 billion was up 26% year over year. Earnings per share of $11.46 increased 5%, reflecting a higher tax rate compared to a year ago.\\n\\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $108 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by gains linked to a minority investment and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 26%. The prior-year quarter included $215 million of discrete tax benefits, while the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $22 million of discrete expense. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024.\\n\\nThe actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $4 billion increased 9% year over year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic base fee growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 4%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis points lower compared to the second quarter.\\n\\nThis was due to the relative outperformance of lower fee U.S. equity markets and client preferences for lower fee U.S. exposures and lower securities lending. The closing of GIP added $116 billion of client AUM and $70 billion of fee-paying AUM on October 1.\\n\\nWe expect GIP to add approximately $250 million of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024. The GIP portfolios contribute competitive private market fee levels that are typically over 100 basis points. They add primarily long-dated, nonredeemable assets to BlackRock's overall business which further diversify our revenue and earnings mix. We expect these private market assets to positively impact BlackRock's overall effective fee rate by 0.5 to 1 full basis point.\\n\\nPerformance fees of $388 million increased significantly from a year ago, primarily reflecting strong alpha generation over the last 12 months from a hedge fund with an annual lock in the third quarter. Quarterly technology services revenue was down 1% compared to a year ago due to the prior-year quarter revenue impact of eFront on-premises license renewals for several large clients. Excluding this impact, technology services revenue would have increased approximately 9% year over year. Sequentially, technology services revenue was up 2%, reflecting successful client go-lives.\\n\\nAnnual contract value, or ACV, increased 15% year over year, driven by sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. In the third quarter, a large U.S. asset manager selected Aladdin to unify its investment management technology platform across public market asset classes. Our ACV results include the impact of this client announcement and a number of other new client mandates.\\n\\nOur results highlight the power of Aladdin as a unifying technology. Aladdin provides a highly scalable operating backbone to clients that's tailored to meet their needs. It enables new capabilities to drive top-line business growth for clients while also unlocking scale and efficiency. Clients recognize a direct positive impact to the bottom line.\\n\\nTotal expense was 8% higher year over year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 10% year over year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. G&A expense was up 8% year over year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend last year and higher professional services expense. Sales, asset, and account expense increased 6% compared to a year ago, driven by higher direct fund expense.\\n\\nDirect fund expense increased 7% year over year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM. Our as-adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was up 350 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue, significantly higher performance fees, and organic base fee growth. As markets improve, we've executed on our financial rubric, aligning controllable expense and organic growth, adding more resilience to our operating margin through greater variabilization of expenses and driving fixed-cost scale. This approach is yielding profitable growth and operating leverage.\\n\\nIn line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin, and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024, and we also expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. In line with this outlook, we would also expect Q4 core G&A to reflect execution of planned technology investment spend at levels more consistent with Q3 and seasonal increases in marketing spend. We welcomed approximately 400 new colleagues to BlackRock following the close of the GIP transaction. Inclusive of the GIP acquisition impact, at present, we'd expect full-year core G&A expense growth to be closer to the high end of the previously communicated range of a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase.\\n\\nOur capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. At the closing of the GIP transaction, we issued and delivered approximately 6.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock, subject to a two-year lockup period. Approximately 30% of the total consideration for the transaction or 5 million shares is deferred and is expected to be issued in approximately five years based on achievement of certain performance milestones.\\n\\nWe repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance. At present, we expect our planned acquisition of Preqin to close around year-end 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. BlackRock's third quarter net inflows of $221 billion were well diversified and positive across client type, product type, active and index, and regions.\\n\\nMomentum in our ETFs continue to build with $97 million of net inflows in the third quarter. Fixed income and core equity led net inflows of $48 billion and $32 billion, respectively. Precision ETFs had $20 billion net inflows as clients efficiently adjusted tactical portfolio allocations would tilt toward U.S. and international developed market equities.\\n\\nBlackRock's cryptocurrency ETPs continue to grow and added $5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Institutional clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with BlackRock, and our institutional franchise raised $56 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Our institutional active franchise saw $27 billion net inflows, primarily in fixed income and multi-asset. Flows benefited from the funding of several large insurance and pension outsourcing mandates.\\n\\nWe also saw positive flows into systematic equity, LifePath target date offerings, and private market strategies. Institutional index net inflows of $29 billion reflected large mandate wins and client-specific asset allocation and rebalancing decisions. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio and inflows into U.S. active fixed income mutual funds.\\n\\nFixed income flows were positive across our municipal bond, high yield, unconstrained, and total return franchises. Demand for our illiquid alternative strategies continued in the third quarter with $1.5 billion of net inflows, driven by infrastructure and private credit. Net inflows also reflected the impact of successful realizations of over $3 billion, primarily from private equity and infrastructure strategies. Finally, cash management saw net inflows of $61 billion in the quarter, driven by both U.S.\\n\\ngovernment and international prime funds, and included multiple large new client mandates. Clients recognize the benefits of our scaled and integrated cash offerings, and this is contributing to sizable inflows of BlackRock. BlackRock delivered one of the strongest quarterly results in our history, and we're in an excellent position to grow with our clients moving ahead into the end of the year and beyond. BlackRock's historically delivered outsized organic growth in periods of investor rerisking, around election cycles, and changes in central bank policy.\\n\\nThe fourth quarter has also been historically strong for inflows. So we're staying connected with our clients. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and to grow our share. As clients increasingly turn to BlackRock, we believe this will result in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage and earnings and multiple expansion over time.\\n\\nThank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, everyone has had a good summer and a really fun fall. Last week, we happened across two milestones on the same day. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock becoming a public company, and we closed our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners.\\n\\nWe're incredibly excited to officially welcome our GIP colleagues to the BlackRock family. We've enjoyed great connectivity with Adebayo and Raj and all the GIP founding partners and we look forward to Adebayo joining our board of directors this quarter. Reflecting on these milestones and those came before, I believe our relationships with clients, with corporations, and with other partners are the strongest they've ever been. The long-term connectors and our relationships span many years as holders of company debt and equity.\\n\\nOur position as a consistent long-term investor differentiates us from opportunistic capital. We are not transactional. We're effectively a perpetual capital, particularly through our index holdings. Those long-standing relationships underpinned by long-term ownership positions are unlocking differentiated partnerships, especially as we expand into private markets.\\n\\nWe founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them. BlackRock has grown as the capital markets have become a bigger and bigger part of the global economy. In my conversations with clients and policymakers around the world, I hear how more and more countries recognize the power of American capital markets and would like to build their own type of capital markets. Record government deficits and tighter bank lending means people, companies, and countries will increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirements, their business, and their economies.\\n\\nThe growth in prosperity-generating power of the capital markets will remain a dominant economic trend in the coming decades, and BlackRock will be an important player in that growth. The opportunities ahead as we have never -- are never been better than we've seen now. We see this through unique deals and partnerships with BlackRock at the center and are accelerating client activity. 2024 net inflows have already surpassed the full-year net inflows of both 2022 and 2023.\\n\\nThe asset we manage on behalf of our clients reached a new high, ending the third quarter at $11.5 trillion. AUM has grown $2.4 trillion or 26% over the last 12 months. In that time, clients have entrusted BlackRock with $456 billion of net assets, including a record $221 billion in the third quarter. Third quarter net inflows and corresponding organic base fee growth of 5% represents our highest level in the last three years, and 15% technology services ACV growth is also at a fresh high.\\n\\nOn our earnings calls earlier this year, we discussed with our shareholders our visibility to a strong pipeline. We shared how this would lead to accelerating organic growth in the second half, and we're seeing that in our results today. We continue to grow our pipeline across the breadth of Aladdin, investment management mandates, and we expect momentum to further build into year end and 2025. We are effectively leveraging our technology, our scale, and our global footprint to deliver profitable growth.\\n\\nQuarterly revenues and operating income both set new records, up 15% and 26%, respectively, year over year. And our 45.8% operating margin is up 350 basis points. Importantly, organic growth has been -- has great breadth and is diversified across BlackRock. For both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, flows were positive in active and index, across all asset classes, across all client types, and across all regions.\\n\\nActives have contributed $28 billion in the third quarter, including positive results in active equities. ETFs remain a secular growth driver, adding $97 billion of net inflows in the quarter and $248 million year to date. We're seeing a broadening of ETF adaptation globally, leading to increased levels of utilization which we believe will only continue. A number of significant whole portfolio institutional mandates funded in the quarter, and we continue to be chosen for large global solutions.\\n\\nLast month, we were selected as a fiduciary manager for a $30 billion Dutch pension fund with more than 30,000 members. Our performance, our technology, and our in-depth knowledge of local investment nuances increasingly make us the preferred partner for institutional clients. Many investors have large cash holdings, Money market industry assets are hitting new records in the quarter, including BlackRock's own cash position, which had $61 billion of net inflows. But investors will have to rerisk to meet their long-term return needs, and we see great opportunities for investors across a number of structural trends continue to build this.\\n\\nThese include rapid advancements in technology and AI and rewiring of globalization and the unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is exceptionally well-positioned in front of that $9 trillion of money market funds across the industry as it makes its way into public and private markets. We are connecting our clients to opportunities and working with them in an integrated whole portfolio lens to help them deploy their capital. We know our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working.\\n\\nBlackRock has become the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. Private markets are becoming increasingly important in the financing of the economy. Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets and powering economic growth. These dynamics are reshaping the landscape of how our clients invest and how they allocate capital within their portfolios.\\n\\nThroughout our history, we've never shied away from making big bets to better serve our clients. As we did when we created Aladdin, unlocking new markets through ETFs and pioneered whole portfolio advisory across active and index, we make coordinated investments to bring private market opportunities to our clients in a better way. By an enthusiasm for the planned integration of GIP and the closing of Preqin has exceeded our own high expectations. Our clients are excited to see how GIP and Preqin capabilities amplified by being part of BlackRock.\\n\\nThe private markets and the clients' allocation to them will continue to grow. Standardized, transparent private market data and analytics will be increasingly important. As with Aladdin, we believe we can add more value to Preqin as both a user and a provider of private market data and risk analytics. Aladdin expanded into new asset classes and markets as BlackRock and our own clients evolve, and we expect the same for Preqin.\\n\\nThe growth of private markets is underpinned by the continued rise of infrastructure. It presents a generational investment opportunity. Over the next 15 years, we'll need to invest $75 trillion to repair aging infrastructure to invest in new projects like data centers and decarbonization technology. The current cash flow inflation-protected return profile of infrastructure makes it an attractive sector for our clients.\\n\\nMost of them will represent investor savings for retirement. With the close of GIP, we are now offering our clients access to market-leading investment and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. Clients will benefit from our substantial scale as the second-largest private market infrastructure managers in the world with $170 billion in client assets, and we have differentiated performance. GIP brings a track record of well-timed and disciplined entries into strategic exits, having returned over $45 billion of capital to investors.\\n\\nWith higher rates, distributions to paid-in capital are a critical measure of success and where we are an industry leader. The combination of BlackRock infrastructure platform with GIP is already unlocking meaningful opportunity for our clients. We recently announced our partnership with Microsoft and MGX across the global AI infrastructure investment partnership. We'll make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet growing demand for compute power.\\n\\nWe'll also invest in energy infrastructures needed to create new sources of power for these facilities. Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructures like data centers and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity. BlackRock is uniquely positioned at the center of this opportunity through our long-standing relationships with corporates, including hyperscalers and energy suppliers and governments around the world. We look forward to be working with our stakeholders in this ecosystem to navigate opportunities and challenges while we also are delivering investment returns for our clients.\\n\\nThis partnership is a powerful demonstration on how our expanded capabilities will enable us to do even more with our clients, investing in one of the largest growth imperatives in the coming decades. In addition to infrastructure, private credit is an important component of our clients' portfolio. We've grown our own broader private market private debt business organically and inorganically in recent years. Today, we manage over $85 billion and diversified across lending, investment-grade private placements, infrastructure, and real estate debt.\\n\\nAnd we've been a top 10 fundraiser over the last decade. BlackRock's nearly $4 trillion in assets across public fixed income, cash, and private credit means we both provide integrated fixed-income solutions for our clients and deliverable scale benefits. Our scale enhance our proprietary deal sourcing, access to the execution of deal flow, deeper liquidity, lowering trading costs, all of which benefits each and every one of our clients. Private markets have mainly been accessible to institutional investors, while private wealth holdings underweight by comparison.\\n\\nFor many wealth investors, the addition of private markets to the portfolio may provide diversification benefits to better returns. To help bridge this gap, we recently announced a partnership with the Partners Group to develop a first-of-its-kind private markets model portfolio solution. We believe it will transform retail access by enabling financial advisors and their clients to add broad-based exposures to the private markets, including to the BlackRock funds. We continue to innovate new investment strategies to improve private market access for our clients backed by our own investment expertise, our proprietary sourcing of deals, and our technology.\\n\\nAs market complexities and opportunities grow, clients need to scale enablers like Aladdin. Clients use Aladdin to consolidate a patchwork of legacy technologies, resulting in greater and better business agility and resilience. It combines risk management, the investment book of record, its performance, its accounting, its risk, and data all in one platform. Clients' research shows that Aladdin's scalable capabilities allow clients to grow faster, operate more efficiently, better risk management with our technology spend over the long term.\\n\\nThe power of Aladdin is resonating with both asset owners and managers. The ACV growth reflected several significant client mandates, including a large public asset manager and one of our largest Aladdin assignments ever. Aladdin is core to the consistent performance our portfolio managers deliver for clients. We leverage our investment insights and technology to bring the performance they demand and deserve.\\n\\nFlows into BlackRock Active strategies accelerated in the third quarter with $28 billion of net inflows, bringing our year-to-date total of $39 billion. This includes demand for active equities led by our high-performing quant strategies, where more than 90% of the AUM is above the one-, three- and five-year period. Across asset classes, investment performance remains strong over the long run. This is resonating in our active flows, in our liquid performance fees, and performance positions us well for future growth.\\n\\nIndex ETFs are increasingly being used within active management, and the ETF structure is being used to pair the alpha generation of leading investors with the liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency offered by ETFs. These dynamics are contributing to client demand globally for iShares ETFs. BlackRock generated in the third quarter ETF net inflows of $97 billion. ETF flows were positive across all segments and major regions, including double-digit organic growth in Europe.\\n\\nThere's more to come with the fourth quarter, which typically brings our seasonally strongest period of the year. Our iShares fixed-income ETF platform recently crossed $1 trillion in assets. And stand alone, it would be a top 5 bond manager by itself. Assets have nearly doubled over the last five years.\\n\\nAll of that growth has been organic and mostly in a flat to down fixed-income beta environment. A more normalized relatively high-rate environment has the potential to encourage investors back even more into fixed income. We continue to innovate in our exchange-traded products to provide better access to markets. This quarter, we launched our Ethereum ETF, which has garnered more than $1 billion of net inflows in the first two months of trading and follows the successful launch of our Bitcoin product, which has now grown to $23 billion in its first nine months, and we will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.\\n\\nOn October 1, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading somewhere around $960. When we went public, it was with a belief in the importance of growth and the depth of the global capital markets. We wanted to share our success with a broader population of people investing for the future, including our employees.\\n\\nThat all still holds true today. Our relentless focus on clients, having a growth mindset, and a willingness to change and evolve has generated a compounded annual total return of over 20% for our shareholders since our IPO 25 years ago. BlackRock has exceeded the total return of the S&P 500 in 19 of those 25 years, representing a business model to serve all our stakeholders. We are better positioned than ever to serve our clients and to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come.\\n\\nI've never felt more optimistic in our positioning as I do today, even after 25 years of being a public firm and 37 years of being a firm. I want to thank all the BlackRock employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and serving our clients with excellence. And again, we welcome our new colleagues from the firm and clients from GIP.\\n\\nThank you. [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\\n\\nHey, good morning. Martin, So my question is on the net flow trajectory. From your broad-based client conversations and your current institutional and funded wind pipeline, do you expect the acceleration rerisking activity continue into next year, post the election? And if your long-term net flow strengthen or stay strong, given that they're already pretty strong in the third quarter, should we expect any outflows in your money market business which I know might be somewhat protected given the institutional scale?\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Craig, for the question. So new inflows are strong, as you said, very healthy on any and all of the measures we track. No question, Craig, we're winning share with our clients. The $221 billion of Q3 flows, they showed great breadth across the business, positive flows in U.S.\\n\\nactive fixed-income mutual funds, systematic equity, LifePath target date. Larry talked about just our long-term active business really shows resilience since 2019. I think we've had positive active flows in 18 of 23 quarters, so we just continue to have a very strong flow performance, 25% higher than full-year Q3, and we still have this seasonally strong Q4 ahead. So we feel like a very healthy trajectory on asset growth.\\n\\nIt's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things with clients. And I think for where we are in the cycle, BlackRock has always been a meaningful outperformer in rerisking period. So going back to previous election cycles or central bank action, if you look at BlackRock, we had outsized upside capture if that was in 2017, '18, '21, and we saw a very strong organic asset growth, as well as organic base fee growth, that was over our long-term targets. So we see that the market and we think the world is lining up for that with our clients.\\n\\nAnd then with respect to money markets, our business is largely institutional. It's been very durable. The $61 billion of flows that's come there, I think, have been good. The trajectory has been very strong this year.\\n\\nI think, Craig, when we look at it, our money market fund business is at $850 billion today. It's nearly 70% bigger than it was five years ago. Cash is a meaningful part of client portfolios, but we're seeing that sort of return to fixed income as well, which has been good for the flow trajectory.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would just add one thing is as the global capital markets become a larger player in the economic activity here in other places in the world, the opportunity for us and our positioning for us is fantastic. And that will allow the backdrop for better flows, more and more exciting opportunities.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nMichael Cyprys -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter here and great to see the meaningful operating leverage as well in the quarter. So just curious how you're pacing investment spend here into '25. How is that evolving? And what are some of the levers to drive margin in the 12 to 18 months? Maybe you can update us on where you are along the journey of variabilizing your expenses.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Mike. I appreciate. It's Martin. So just that contextually, right, our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate industry-leading differentiated organic growth to drive operating leverage and industry-leading margins and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy.\\n\\nWe've got a strong track record at BlackRock of investing in the business for growth and scale while also expanding profitability. It's not just about growth. It's about profitable growth over the long term. And so our growth comes from being very disciplined in making and managing continued investments in our business.\\n\\nWe've dubbed this our financial rubric, which I mentioned. We size our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variabilizing more expenses where we can, and we've made a lot of progress there. And most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed-cost scale, especially through investments in technology.\\n\\nWe've got a consistent track record of delivering industry-leading margins and improving them. And I'd say the scale indicators, they're really coming through the results. We generated 350 basis points of margin expansion year over year while operating income rose 26%. And since the end of '22, BlackRock assets under management are up $3 trillion, while headcount is broadly flat.\\n\\nSo we're delivering the benefits of scale and productivity which is showing in our margin expansion. We continue to believe that technology, automation from footprinting are the major levers there for us to continue to drive that margin expansion. And the last thing I'd say is just market movements. Market movements beta, that's our highest margin item, both when markets move meaningfully up or down.\\n\\nAnd we continue to see conditions for reasonably positive growth in the markets over the near to intermediate term, so we believe we can continue to invest to accelerate organic growth and deliver margin expansion using this financial rubric that we've laid out.\\n\\nI'm good. Thanks. Question for you guys on private markets. There's a couple of topics.\\n\\nBut maybe starting with GIP, helpful to maybe just to get a mark to market on some of the financial elements. I know, Martin, you talked about $250 million, I think, in management fee in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving into 2025? What are some of the kind of fund flow dynamics on the legacy GIP side? And what are some of the things that you guys are working with them together? And also, if you could just remind us what the operating margin on that business is as well out of the gate as well.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Alex. So just the closing of GIP, it's a great milestone in BlackRock's history. We're really excited to welcome over 400 new colleagues to welcome the leadership team, Adebayo, Raj, Michael, Jon, everybody. Our clients are excited.\\n\\nThe consultants that we've been working with are excited. The corporate partners are excited, so we're really eager to partner on this new platform. And the reception, as Larry mentioned, has been overwhelmingly positive. For us, this is a revenue growth story.\\n\\nThis is about expanding capabilities. We're working to unlock substantial growth synergies across origination, capital formation, and platform scale. We're seeing excellent momentum in fundraising for -- across the platform at GIP, at BlackRock and have, I'd say, really strong ambitions, especially around the AI innovation fund that Larry mentioned. As I mentioned on the call -- in my earlier remarks, we're consolidating $116 billion of GIP AUM -- client AUM, $70 billion of fee-paying AUM.\\n\\nWe're doubling private markets run-rate management fees at BlackRock in the transaction, think about GIP adding, as we said on the call, annualized north of $400 million of earnings at sort of 50-ish percent margins. $250 million in management fees, we expect to come in the fourth quarter. So I'd model sort of $1 billion of fees with an FRE margin north of 50% when we think about 2025 in terms of GIP.\\n\\nOK, great. Sorry about that. I was hoping you could discuss your appetite for additional M&A. And what constraints you have financially, but more importantly, as a management team to appropriately integrate the recent deals and really maximize the opportunity you have with these transactions?\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAll right. Thanks so much for the question. As I said, we're really excited for our clients about GIP and Preqin. This is a meaningful acceleration in our private markets' capabilities.\\n\\nAnd I think just as I mentioned in the last question, it's a major financial contributor for BlackRock, but it's going to take some work to integrate well and realize the planned synergies of this transaction. So right now, we're very focused on integrating GIP and closing Preqin, and we're focused on delivering a great integration experience for clients and employees. We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business, and inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets. Look at this quarter.\\n\\nWe've hit our 5% organic base fee growth target, and we see excellent momentum. So we'll continue to be prudent with our capital and financial position. And consistent with our long-term approach, we'll evaluate inorganic opportunities that have the benefit for our clients and shareholders. We're always going to be very rigorous and selective in those criteria and entertain possibilities that have clear alignment with our culture, strategy, and long-term organic growth.\\n\\nWe have great capabilities here, Dan. So across infrastructure now, we've got $170 billion platform. We have an $85 billion private credit platform. We have a huge opportunity to grow inorganically in private credit with our insurance clients.\\n\\nWe're the largest core fixed-income manager in the world for insurance companies with organic. We're the largest organic opportunity to grow organic opportunity to grow with our insurance clients. We manage $700 billion of insurance company general account assets for them. So if you think about the conversations we're having with CIOs to integrate our private credit capabilities into that GA, if we can just flip -- if we can flip 10% of the $700 billion into private credit strategies, that's $70 billion of opportunity sitting with existing clients with the capabilities that we have today.\\n\\nThanks very much. So I think we're all pretty impressed with the broad growth that you keep putting up and huge margins, too, so I want a high-level question. You mentioned the word multiple expansion once or twice during the conversation, and just I think earnings growth needs to be part of the equation, too. And you have strong growth in everything.\\n\\nYou have big margins. I'm just curious why 5% EPS growth this quarter. Should we expect these initiatives as they layer in and you consistently hit the targets to actually bring the earnings growth along with it, too? I appreciate that.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks so much for the question, Glenn. So we're focused on driving differentiated organic growth, meeting our 5% organic growth targets through the cycle, driving operating leverage. And as you said, I think you see those results very much coming through. We think if we are able to drive 5% organic growth, continue to execute on this financial rubric I laid out, we should be able to drive industry-leading margins and margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth.\\n\\nI think in the quarter, I mentioned our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter. And that's the main driver between some of that lighter EPS here was the $22 million of discrete expense that we had in this quarter versus the $215 million of benefit that we had last year from discretes.\\n\\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.\\n\\nMaybe just back to the 5% organic base fee growth and maybe a different angle on this in terms of the fee rate. Obviously, the rate's going up with the GIP acquisition of that 0.5 to 1 basis point. Do you feel better now than you have maybe in a long time on the potential for the fee rate to either be stable or even move up sequentially in the next several years versus the fee pressure that you've seen? And I know that's all been due to mix in the past. But now the composition of your future organic growth seems to be tilted more toward the private markets, toward higher fee products versus obviously some of the lower mandates that you've been bringing in and also the core iSeries -- iShares, of course, your iShares, sorry.\\n\\nSo bottom line is do you feel better about that fee rate growth potential? And maybe if you can just touch on the model portfolios partnership as well in terms of the organic growth potential there.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely. Thanks so much for the question. So we generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, so 5% annualized organic base fee growth. We're excited about that.\\n\\nContinue to see great momentum just in our organic growth. We're growing revenues and operating income at double-digit rates and expanding margin. Average AUM growth was 18% higher than base fee growth, and that was mainly due to relative outperformance of lower fee rate U.S. equities or what you all in our analyst community would call divergent beta.\\n\\nSo spot AUM of $11.5 trillion ended the quarter about 4% higher than average AUM, and so our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis points lower sequentially. More macro just on the fee rate. On our AUM, the fee rate, it's a backward-looking output basically of the mix of the stock of assets that we manage and net new flows and net new fields on the fee rate. It's primarily affected by beta and FX and also by organic growth.\\n\\nAnd so over more recent periods, U.S. public equity markets, which are a lower fee rate segment, they've grown faster than international equities, and that's been a driver of these fee rate trends on our platform. And in those environments, strong U.S. equities, also the new base fee growth tends to occur at relatively lower fields to international or EM equities.\\n\\nFee rate for us, it's primarily an output. It's not the basis or driver of the strategy. We're focused on meeting client needs across the whole portfolio. We're focused on technology.\\n\\nWe're focused on driving organic growth in the most efficient way possible, but I do think you're grabbing on the point that we see, which is, as we grow our private markets business, and we're going to go from $170 billion of client AUM with GIP to, call it, $285 billion of client AUM. As we grow our private markets business, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue. We'd expect to see positive leverage to average fee rates and organic growth over time. Going into Q4, ex GIP, we'd expect the entry rate to be flat.\\n\\nAnd as I noted, consolidation of the GIP portfolios into our business is expected to lift the fee rate by about 0.5 to 1 full basis point. So in the longer term, as we see illiquids in private markets is a bigger contributor to our business mix, we would expect that to have positive leverage on the fee rate.\\n\\nOK. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Happy anniversary.\\n\\nI think I was there at the beginning, had to say. Indeed, I remember that meeting like it was yesterday. So a question for you. I was very intrigued by your statement about revolutionizing the wealth management opportunity.\\n\\nI was wondering if you could maybe unpack that a little bit. I think you mentioned that the whole portfolio opportunity could be better than everything on the evergreen side to date. And just wondering if you could expand your thinking a little bit, just so we get a sense of the magnitude and the opportunity and maybe any go-to-market strategy we should be thinking about as we look into the new year.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Bill. Very much appreciate the question. So we have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. Our aim is to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private markets exposures.\\n\\nI think if you go back to the last several investor days we've had, we've talked about building the -- we're talking about building the portfolio of the future for wealth managers, which is digitally enabled. It's public-private. And this market, I think, is still very early. Retail allocation to private markets still remains in low single digits.\\n\\nJust on capabilities for us here, we have a great established leading franchise in retail liquid alternatives. We've got over $40 billion of assets here across merger arb, systematic, multi-strategy, commodity exposures. We've had a lot of success in bringing retail alts to retirement in the U.K. and Europe through the LTIP and LTAP restructures.\\n\\nWe've been building out our evergreen and credit interval funds here in the United States. We have a credit strategies interval fund. We have a nontraded credit BDC B debt, which are combined to be over $1 billion today. BDC's well placed for RIAs, independent broker-dealers, offshore wealth, and we think this can be a strong grower for us.\\n\\nBut as you said, longer term, our aspiration is to integrate semi-liquid products into our over $300 billion managed models and SMAs. That would be the most significant unlock, and we feel competitive advantage we have. It's at the heart of the models venture that we've entered into with Partners Group. But I'd say it's consistently.\\n\\nIt's part of the partnerships we have with Envestnet, with GOL, with iCapital, with Case, with Vestmark. Our goal is to make model portfolios seamless in terms of public-private in the same way we've been able to do that in the same way that we've been able to do that with ETF and mutual fund active model portfolio. So we have a lot more work to do on that, but we're excited about the opportunity.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nBill, let me add more to that answer. As we believed when we acquired BGI that ETFs would become the instrument of so much of the activity in the capital market, and it's certainly been that way. Even in 2012, when we said ETFs are going to be expanding heavily in fixed income, to the surprise of so many people, and we crossed $1 trillion of that. What we are seeing now in private markets is a blending of public and private, and that's going to continue to blend.\\n\\nInstitutional clients are going to be looking at measurements of liquidity, and they're going to be trading in between public and privates, and that will become the new domain. And so we're not going to look at private markets in the same way like -- we're not going to say they're alternatives. They're just part of the marketplace itself. And one of the reasons why we were so driven to acquire Preqin, we believe that data and analytics will accelerate that movement of making public and private ubiquitous together.\\n\\nAnd what we're going to look at is liquidity as the driver of risk as we're going to be blending liquidity from the public markets, the liquidity, the private markets and making risk assessments. And if through the data analytics that we could have combining Preqin, Aladdin, and eFront, if we could build that platform into more transparency in privates, more opportunities for privates, this idea of the blending in public and privates will become a reality, just like the reality of how ETFs became the driving forces of so many of the markets now, and we believe that will happen, too. But it's going to happen with the acceleration of data and analytics. So when we -- when you think about these retail platforms that will be driving more private type of exposures, it will accelerate only when we have better data analytics, transparency, indexing, and that is a major component of our strategy going forward.\\n\\nGood morning, and thank you for having me on the call. Wanted to ask about your ambitions in digital assets to maybe changed up a little bit. It seems like one way or another, we're going to have a new president next year who's going to be more friendly to the industry, and it could take some time to see new rules and regulations. I'm just wondering, what do you see as the key opportunities for BlackRock that this change in posture from Washington could unlock sort of beyond the ETF business and some of the other custody things you do? Thank you.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, first, I'm not sure either president -- or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide. Conversations we're having with institutions worldwide, conversations about how should they think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be. I mean, we believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.\\n\\nIt is an alternative to other commodities like gold, and so I think the application of this form of investment will it be expanded to the role of the cerium as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded. And I truly don't believe it's a function of regulation -- of more regulation, less regulation. I think it's a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you -- years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred, started off very slow.\\n\\nBut it built as we build better analytics and data and then to better analytics and data, more acceptance, and a broadening of the market. And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets. And then we'll see how do -- does each and every country look at their own digital currency, but that's a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself. But I do believe the -- what we're going to witness as we build out better analytics.\\n\\nAnd then the question is, as you mentioned, regulation. How do we see in this country the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play? That's a very different question related to like, let's say, Bitcoin and other items like that, but all of that is going to be under discussion. And what we're witnessing in other countries that we're seeing big success in India and Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons. But we believe the technology of these blockchains are going to become very additive.\\n\\nAnd then you overlay AI and having better data analytics, the applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur.\\n\\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious whether you all have seen any changes in the RFP activity on the fixed income side? There's recently been some regulatory issues at a large institutional bond manager, so kind of curious about what you're seeing in the market there on the back of that.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo if you look at our announcement this quarter, we announced we won a $30 billion mandate from a pension fund. There are -- it is not uncommon to see big, large changes in the marketplace. I don't want to talk about one client or another client or what's happening with one manager versus another manager.

There's a very large institutional mandates that are going to be up for that there's an RFP right now, and so I don't look at this as any different. Obviously, there are some issues around that are in the press, but money in motion occurs every quarter.\\n\\nThere are large opportunities every quarter. And I think one thing that we see consistently as OCIO mandates occur, they're occurring with more regularity and with more opportunity, and this is away from the topic that you brought up. But it's important to just note this is not uncommon seeing large blocks of business moving around, and I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAt this time, this does conclude today's Q&A session. And I'd like to turn the call back to Larry Fink for any additional or closing remarks.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock over these last 25 years. Our third quarter results are possible because of the global network of relationships we've created, our data and analytics that are differentiated by all imagination, and importantly, our integrated technology that we've built over many, many years. We have a long history of good integration, whether it's the integration of BGI, Malin, Aperio, eFront.\\n\\nAnd now we're working on a successful close and integration of GIP, and we expect the same thing of a closing and integration of Preqin around year end. And I believe our position has never been better. And I believe as we look forward to delivering strong performance for our clients, we will create differentiated growth for you, our shareholders, in the coming years ahead.

Meat Substitutes Market in India is propelled by the increasing adoption of plant-based innovative food products. In a predominantly vegetarian market, religious beliefs significantly influence the preference for vegetarian over meat products in India. The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this inclination towards vegetarian and vegan choices, especially among traditional meat consumers, fostering a heightened interest in plant-based meat alternatives. The market expansion is fueled by the growing appeal of healthier, sustainable, and cruelty-free options, with high-income consumers driving this trend. Ethical consumerism and environmental awareness contribute to the demand for plant-based meat products, while increased consciousness regarding the environmental impact of meat production prompts eco-conscious consumers to limit or avoid meat consumption.

      "    \"title\": \"BlackRock (BLK) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool\",\n",
      "    \"body\": \"Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. third quarter 2024 earnings teleconference.\\n\\nOur host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer Martin S. Small, President Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel Christopher J.\\n\\nMeade. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\\n\\nChristopher J. Meade -- General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer\\n\\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the general counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.\\n\\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\\n\\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results.\\n\\nOur earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. On our previous earnings call, we spoke to improving client sentiment and steadily improving organic growth. We sounded optimism about our growth trajectory in the second half of the year.\\n\\nAnd in the third quarter, organic growth surged, and BlackRock delivered some of the best financial results in our history. We generated $221 billion of net inflows, our highest net flows quarter ever. We delivered record levels of quarterly revenue and operating income. We expanded our margin by 350 basis points year over year.\\n\\nWe generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest quarter in three years. Organic growth is accelerating as we execute on a strong pipeline, and clients turn to BlackRock to move in size into public and private markets. Our structural growers, iShares; whole portfolio outsourcing, Aladdin, the structural growers all delivered strong third quarter growth and are poised to accelerate into year end. iShares.\\n\\niShares is leading the industry in global flows with approximately $250 billion through the third quarter and historically sees upwards of 40% of its total annual flows in Q4. Fixed-income ETFs, built cheaply on organic growth. iShares' fixed-income ETF assets now stand at over $1 trillion, nearly 40% higher than at year-end 2021. And Aladdin.\\n\\nAladdin logs 15% ACV growth, consistent with our long-term low to mid-teens target with excellent momentum and key wins with growing clients. Finally, fixed income. Fixed income delivered across the platform with over $60 billion of net inflows. We believe the continued path of central bank normalization will support sustained inflows across bond funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts.\\n\\nFixed income remains a compelling organic growth opportunity for BlackRock. Private markets are a strategic priority for BlackRock, delivering world-class private markets capabilities to more deeply serve clients across the whole portfolio. On October 1, we closed on our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. The combination triples infrastructure AUM and doubles private markets run-rate management fees.\\n\\nWe're already seeing the power of BlackRock and GIP together. Our partnership with Microsoft and MGX. It aims to realize the enormous investment potential of infrastructure to support AI innovation, and it's just the first proof point of the growth synergies we can create together. We're bringing private markets to wealth clients.\\n\\nBlackRock manages more than $300 billion of assets across model portfolios and separately managed accounts for wealth managers. These portfolios would benefit from increased exposure and more efficient access to the private markets. We believe the model portfolio solution we're building with Partners Group will revolutionize access to private markets for wealth managers and improve portfolio outcomes for millions of households on an even bigger scale than what's been done with evergreen funds. And as long observed in markets, information about capital has become almost as important as capital itself.\\n\\nOur planned acquisition of Preqin is accelerating this exciting private markets data and analytics journey for BlackRock and our clients. Our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients through access to unique opportunities, expertise, and world-class client service. We're also moving swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to continue to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. We're building our mix toward higher secular growth areas, like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates, and model portfolios.\\n\\nWe believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater diversification, and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Successful execution of these goals should also result in multiple expansion for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with AUM near $11.5 trillion, 11.5 trillion units of trust clients building with BlackRock. Our business tends to be seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and we maintain line of sight into a broad, global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel organic growth.\\n\\nBlackRock generated total net inflows of $221 billion in the third quarter, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth. Third quarter revenue of $5.2 billion was 15% higher year over year, driven by 5% organic base fee growth, the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months, and alpha generation in our liquid alternative strategies. Operating income of $2.1 billion was up 26% year over year. Earnings per share of $11.46 increased 5%, reflecting a higher tax rate compared to a year ago.\\n\\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $108 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by gains linked to a minority investment and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 26%. The prior-year quarter included $215 million of discrete tax benefits, while the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $22 million of discrete expense. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024.\\n\\nThe actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $4 billion increased 9% year over year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic base fee growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 4%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis points lower compared to the second quarter.\\n\\nThis was due to the relative outperformance of lower fee U.S. equity markets and client preferences for lower fee U.S. exposures and lower securities lending. The closing of GIP added $116 billion of client AUM and $70 billion of fee-paying AUM on October 1.\\n\\nWe expect GIP to add approximately $250 million of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024. The GIP portfolios contribute competitive private market fee levels that are typically over 100 basis points. They add primarily long-dated, nonredeemable assets to BlackRock's overall business which further diversify our revenue and earnings mix. We expect these private market assets to positively impact BlackRock's overall effective fee rate by 0.5 to 1 full basis point.\\n\\nPerformance fees of $388 million increased significantly from a year ago, primarily reflecting strong alpha generation over the last 12 months from a hedge fund with an annual lock in the third quarter. Quarterly technology services revenue was down 1% compared to a year ago due to the prior-year quarter revenue impact of eFront on-premises license renewals for several large clients. Excluding this impact, technology services revenue would have increased approximately 9% year over year. Sequentially, technology services revenue was up 2%, reflecting successful client go-lives.\\n\\nAnnual contract value, or ACV, increased 15% year over year, driven by sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. In the third quarter, a large U.S. asset manager selected Aladdin to unify its investment management technology platform across public market asset classes. Our ACV results include the impact of this client announcement and a number of other new client mandates.\\n\\nOur results highlight the power of Aladdin as a unifying technology. Aladdin provides a highly scalable operating backbone to clients that's tailored to meet their needs. It enables new capabilities to drive top-line business growth for clients while also unlocking scale and efficiency. Clients recognize a direct positive impact to the bottom line.\\n\\nTotal expense was 8% higher year over year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 10% year over year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. G&A expense was up 8% year over year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend last year and higher professional services expense. Sales, asset, and account expense increased 6% compared to a year ago, driven by higher direct fund expense.\\n\\nDirect fund expense increased 7% year over year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM. Our as-adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was up 350 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue, significantly higher performance fees, and organic base fee growth. As markets improve, we've executed on our financial rubric, aligning controllable expense and organic growth, adding more resilience to our operating margin through greater variabilization of expenses and driving fixed-cost scale. This approach is yielding profitable growth and operating leverage.\\n\\nIn line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin, and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024, and we also expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. In line with this outlook, we would also expect Q4 core G&A to reflect execution of planned technology investment spend at levels more consistent with Q3 and seasonal increases in marketing spend. We welcomed approximately 400 new colleagues to BlackRock following the close of the GIP transaction. Inclusive of the GIP acquisition impact, at present, we'd expect full-year core G&A expense growth to be closer to the high end of the previously communicated range of a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase.\\n\\nOur capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. At the closing of the GIP transaction, we issued and delivered approximately 6.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock, subject to a two-year lockup period. Approximately 30% of the total consideration for the transaction or 5 million shares is deferred and is expected to be issued in approximately five years based on achievement of certain performance milestones.\\n\\nWe repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance. At present, we expect our planned acquisition of Preqin to close around year-end 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. BlackRock's third quarter net inflows of $221 billion were well diversified and positive across client type, product type, active and index, and regions.\\n\\nMomentum in our ETFs continue to build with $97 million of net inflows in the third quarter. Fixed income and core equity led net inflows of $48 billion and $32 billion, respectively. Precision ETFs had $20 billion net inflows as clients efficiently adjusted tactical portfolio allocations would tilt toward U.S. and international developed market equities.\\n\\nBlackRock's cryptocurrency ETPs continue to grow and added $5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Institutional clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with BlackRock, and our institutional franchise raised $56 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Our institutional active franchise saw $27 billion net inflows, primarily in fixed income and multi-asset. Flows benefited from the funding of several large insurance and pension outsourcing mandates.\\n\\nWe also saw positive flows into systematic equity, LifePath target date offerings, and private market strategies. Institutional index net inflows of $29 billion reflected large mandate wins and client-specific asset allocation and rebalancing decisions. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio and inflows into U.S. active fixed income mutual funds.\\n\\nFixed income flows were positive across our municipal bond, high yield, unconstrained, and total return franchises. Demand for our illiquid alternative strategies continued in the third quarter with $1.5 billion of net inflows, driven by infrastructure and private credit. Net inflows also reflected the impact of successful realizations of over $3 billion, primarily from private equity and infrastructure strategies. Finally, cash management saw net inflows of $61 billion in the quarter, driven by both U.S.\\n\\ngovernment and international prime funds, and included multiple large new client mandates. Clients recognize the benefits of our scaled and integrated cash offerings, and this is contributing to sizable inflows of BlackRock. BlackRock delivered one of the strongest quarterly results in our history, and we're in an excellent position to grow with our clients moving ahead into the end of the year and beyond. BlackRock's historically delivered outsized organic growth in periods of investor rerisking, around election cycles, and changes in central bank policy.\\n\\nThe fourth quarter has also been historically strong for inflows. So we're staying connected with our clients. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and to grow our share. As clients increasingly turn to BlackRock, we believe this will result in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage and earnings and multiple expansion over time.\\n\\nThank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, everyone has had a good summer and a really fun fall. Last week, we happened across two milestones on the same day. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock becoming a public company, and we closed our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners.\\n\\nWe're incredibly excited to officially welcome our GIP colleagues to the BlackRock family. We've enjoyed great connectivity with Adebayo and Raj and all the GIP founding partners and we look forward to Adebayo joining our board of directors this quarter. Reflecting on these milestones and those came before, I believe our relationships with clients, with corporations, and with other partners are the strongest they've ever been. The long-term connectors and our relationships span many years as holders of company debt and equity.\\n\\nOur position as a consistent long-term investor differentiates us from opportunistic capital. We are not transactional. We're effectively a perpetual capital, particularly through our index holdings. Those long-standing relationships underpinned by long-term ownership positions are unlocking differentiated partnerships, especially as we expand into private markets.\\n\\nWe founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them. BlackRock has grown as the capital markets have become a bigger and bigger part of the global economy. In my conversations with clients and policymakers around the world, I hear how more and more countries recognize the power of American capital markets and would like to build their own type of capital markets. Record government deficits and tighter bank lending means people, companies, and countries will increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirements, their business, and their economies.\\n\\nThe growth in prosperity-generating power of the capital markets will remain a dominant economic trend in the coming decades, and BlackRock will be an important player in that growth. The opportunities ahead as we have never -- are never been better than we've seen now. We see this through unique deals and partnerships with BlackRock at the center and are accelerating client activity. 2024 net inflows have already surpassed the full-year net inflows of both 2022 and 2023.\\n\\nThe asset we manage on behalf of our clients reached a new high, ending the third quarter at $11.5 trillion. AUM has grown $2.4 trillion or 26% over the last 12 months. In that time, clients have entrusted BlackRock with $456 billion of net assets, including a record $221 billion in the third quarter. Third quarter net inflows and corresponding organic base fee growth of 5% represents our highest level in the last three years, and 15% technology services ACV growth is also at a fresh high.\\n\\nOn our earnings calls earlier this year, we discussed with our shareholders our visibility to a strong pipeline. We shared how this would lead to accelerating organic growth in the second half, and we're seeing that in our results today. We continue to grow our pipeline across the breadth of Aladdin, investment management mandates, and we expect momentum to further build into year end and 2025. We are effectively leveraging our technology, our scale, and our global footprint to deliver profitable growth.\\n\\nQuarterly revenues and operating income both set new records, up 15% and 26%, respectively, year over year. And our 45.8% operating margin is up 350 basis points. Importantly, organic growth has been -- has great breadth and is diversified across BlackRock. For both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, flows were positive in active and index, across all asset classes, across all client types, and across all regions.\\n\\nActives have contributed $28 billion in the third quarter, including positive results in active equities. ETFs remain a secular growth driver, adding $97 billion of net inflows in the quarter and $248 million year to date. We're seeing a broadening of ETF adaptation globally, leading to increased levels of utilization which we believe will only continue. A number of significant whole portfolio institutional mandates funded in the quarter, and we continue to be chosen for large global solutions.\\n\\nLast month, we were selected as a fiduciary manager for a $30 billion Dutch pension fund with more than 30,000 members. Our performance, our technology, and our in-depth knowledge of local investment nuances increasingly make us the preferred partner for institutional clients. Many investors have large cash holdings, Money market industry assets are hitting new records in the quarter, including BlackRock's own cash position, which had $61 billion of net inflows. But investors will have to rerisk to meet their long-term return needs, and we see great opportunities for investors across a number of structural trends continue to build this.\\n\\nThese include rapid advancements in technology and AI and rewiring of globalization and the unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is exceptionally well-positioned in front of that $9 trillion of money market funds across the industry as it makes its way into public and private markets. We are connecting our clients to opportunities and working with them in an integrated whole portfolio lens to help them deploy their capital. We know our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working.\\n\\nBlackRock has become the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. Private markets are becoming increasingly important in the financing of the economy. Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets and powering economic growth. These dynamics are reshaping the landscape of how our clients invest and how they allocate capital within their portfolios.\\n\\nThroughout our history, we've never shied away from making big bets to better serve our clients. As we did when we created Aladdin, unlocking new markets through ETFs and pioneered whole portfolio advisory across active and index, we make coordinated investments to bring private market opportunities to our clients in a better way. By an enthusiasm for the planned integration of GIP and the closing of Preqin has exceeded our own high expectations. Our clients are excited to see how GIP and Preqin capabilities amplified by being part of BlackRock.\\n\\nThe private markets and the clients' allocation to them will continue to grow. Standardized, transparent private market data and analytics will be increasingly important. As with Aladdin, we believe we can add more value to Preqin as both a user and a provider of private market data and risk analytics. Aladdin expanded into new asset classes and markets as BlackRock and our own clients evolve, and we expect the same for Preqin.\\n\\nThe growth of private markets is underpinned by the continued rise of infrastructure. It presents a generational investment opportunity. Over the next 15 years, we'll need to invest $75 trillion to repair aging infrastructure to invest in new projects like data centers and decarbonization technology. The current cash flow inflation-protected return profile of infrastructure makes it an attractive sector for our clients.\\n\\nMost of them will represent investor savings for retirement. With the close of GIP, we are now offering our clients access to market-leading investment and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. Clients will benefit from our substantial scale as the second-largest private market infrastructure managers in the world with $170 billion in client assets, and we have differentiated performance. GIP brings a track record of well-timed and disciplined entries into strategic exits, having returned over $45 billion of capital to investors.\\n\\nWith higher rates, distributions to paid-in capital are a critical measure of success and where we are an industry leader. The combination of BlackRock infrastructure platform with GIP is already unlocking meaningful opportunity for our clients. We recently announced our partnership with Microsoft and MGX across the global AI infrastructure investment partnership. We'll make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet growing demand for compute power.\\n\\nWe'll also invest in energy infrastructures needed to create new sources of power for these facilities. Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructures like data centers and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity. BlackRock is uniquely positioned at the center of this opportunity through our long-standing relationships with corporates, including hyperscalers and energy suppliers and governments around the world. We look forward to be working with our stakeholders in this ecosystem to navigate opportunities and challenges while we also are delivering investment returns for our clients.\\n\\nThis partnership is a powerful demonstration on how our expanded capabilities will enable us to do even more with our clients, investing in one of the largest growth imperatives in the coming decades. In addition to infrastructure, private credit is an important component of our clients' portfolio. We've grown our own broader private market private debt business organically and inorganically in recent years. Today, we manage over $85 billion and diversified across lending, investment-grade private placements, infrastructure, and real estate debt.\\n\\nAnd we've been a top 10 fundraiser over the last decade. BlackRock's nearly $4 trillion in assets across public fixed income, cash, and private credit means we both provide integrated fixed-income solutions for our clients and deliverable scale benefits. Our scale enhance our proprietary deal sourcing, access to the execution of deal flow, deeper liquidity, lowering trading costs, all of which benefits each and every one of our clients. Private markets have mainly been accessible to institutional investors, while private wealth holdings underweight by comparison.\\n\\nFor many wealth investors, the addition of private markets to the portfolio may provide diversification benefits to better returns. To help bridge this gap, we recently announced a partnership with the Partners Group to develop a first-of-its-kind private markets model portfolio solution. We believe it will transform retail access by enabling financial advisors and their clients to add broad-based exposures to the private markets, including to the BlackRock funds. We continue to innovate new investment strategies to improve private market access for our clients backed by our own investment expertise, our proprietary sourcing of deals, and our technology.\\n\\nAs market complexities and opportunities grow, clients need to scale enablers like Aladdin. Clients use Aladdin to consolidate a patchwork of legacy technologies, resulting in greater and better business agility and resilience. It combines risk management, the investment book of record, its performance, its accounting, its risk, and data all in one platform. Clients' research shows that Aladdin's scalable capabilities allow clients to grow faster, operate more efficiently, better risk management with our technology spend over the long term.\\n\\nThe power of Aladdin is resonating with both asset owners and managers. The ACV growth reflected several significant client mandates, including a large public asset manager and one of our largest Aladdin assignments ever. Aladdin is core to the consistent performance our portfolio managers deliver for clients. We leverage our investment insights and technology to bring the performance they demand and deserve.\\n\\nFlows into BlackRock Active strategies accelerated in the third quarter with $28 billion of net inflows, bringing our year-to-date total of $39 billion. This includes demand for active equities led by our high-performing quant strategies, where more than 90% of the AUM is above the one-, three- and five-year period. Across asset classes, investment performance remains strong over the long run. This is resonating in our active flows, in our liquid performance fees, and performance positions us well for future growth.\\n\\nIndex ETFs are increasingly being used within active management, and the ETF structure is being used to pair the alpha generation of leading investors with the liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency offered by ETFs. These dynamics are contributing to client demand globally for iShares ETFs. BlackRock generated in the third quarter ETF net inflows of $97 billion. ETF flows were positive across all segments and major regions, including double-digit organic growth in Europe.\\n\\nThere's more to come with the fourth quarter, which typically brings our seasonally strongest period of the year. Our iShares fixed-income ETF platform recently crossed $1 trillion in assets. And stand alone, it would be a top 5 bond manager by itself. Assets have nearly doubled over the last five years.\\n\\nAll of that growth has been organic and mostly in a flat to down fixed-income beta environment. A more normalized relatively high-rate environment has the potential to encourage investors back even more into fixed income. We continue to innovate in our exchange-traded products to provide better access to markets. This quarter, we launched our Ethereum ETF, which has garnered more than $1 billion of net inflows in the first two months of trading and follows the successful launch of our Bitcoin product, which has now grown to $23 billion in its first nine months, and we will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.\\n\\nOn October 1, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading somewhere around $960. When we went public, it was with a belief in the importance of growth and the depth of the global capital markets. We wanted to share our success with a broader population of people investing for the future, including our employees.\\n\\nThat all still holds true today. Our relentless focus on clients, having a growth mindset, and a willingness to change and evolve has generated a compounded annual total return of over 20% for our shareholders since our IPO 25 years ago. BlackRock has exceeded the total return of the S&P 500 in 19 of those 25 years, representing a business model to serve all our stakeholders. We are better positioned than ever to serve our clients and to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come.\\n\\nI've never felt more optimistic in our positioning as I do today, even after 25 years of being a public firm and 37 years of being a firm. I want to thank all the BlackRock employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and serving our clients with excellence. And again, we welcome our new colleagues from the firm and clients from GIP.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\\n\\nHey, good morning. Martin, So my question is on the net flow trajectory. From your broad-based client conversations and your current institutional and funded wind pipeline, do you expect the acceleration rerisking activity continue into next year, post the election? And if your long-term net flow strengthen or stay strong, given that they're already pretty strong in the third quarter, should we expect any outflows in your money market business which I know might be somewhat protected given the institutional scale?\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Craig, for the question. So new inflows are strong, as you said, very healthy on any and all of the measures we track. No question, Craig, we're winning share with our clients. The $221 billion of Q3 flows, they showed great breadth across the business, positive flows in U.S.\\n\\nactive fixed-income mutual funds, systematic equity, LifePath target date. Larry talked about just our long-term active business really shows resilience since 2019. I think we've had positive active flows in 18 of 23 quarters, so we just continue to have a very strong flow performance, 25% higher than full-year Q3, and we still have this seasonally strong Q4 ahead. So we feel like a very healthy trajectory on asset growth.\\n\\nIt's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things with clients. And I think for where we are in the cycle, BlackRock has always been a meaningful outperformer in rerisking period. So going back to previous election cycles or central bank action, if you look at BlackRock, we had outsized upside capture if that was in 2017, '18, '21, and we saw a very strong organic asset growth, as well as organic base fee growth, that was over our long-term targets. So we see that the market and we think the world is lining up for that with our clients.\\n\\nAnd then with respect to money markets, our business is largely institutional. It's been very durable. The $61 billion of flows that's come there, I think, have been good. The trajectory has been very strong this year.\\n\\nI think, Craig, when we look at it, our money market fund business is at $850 billion today. It's nearly 70% bigger than it was five years ago. Cash is a meaningful part of client portfolios, but we're seeing that sort of return to fixed income as well, which has been good for the flow trajectory.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would just add one thing is as the global capital markets become a larger player in the economic activity here in other places in the world, the opportunity for us and our positioning for us is fantastic. And that will allow the backdrop for better flows, more and more exciting opportunities.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nMichael Cyprys -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter here and great to see the meaningful operating leverage as well in the quarter. So just curious how you're pacing investment spend here into '25. How is that evolving? And what are some of the levers to drive margin in the 12 to 18 months? Maybe you can update us on where you are along the journey of variabilizing your expenses.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Mike. I appreciate. It's Martin. So just that contextually, right, our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate industry-leading differentiated organic growth to drive operating leverage and industry-leading margins and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy.\\n\\nWe've got a strong track record at BlackRock of investing in the business for growth and scale while also expanding profitability. It's not just about growth. It's about profitable growth over the long term. And so our growth comes from being very disciplined in making and managing continued investments in our business.\\n\\nWe've dubbed this our financial rubric, which I mentioned. We size our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variabilizing more expenses where we can, and we've made a lot of progress there. And most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed-cost scale, especially through investments in technology.\\n\\nWe've got a consistent track record of delivering industry-leading margins and improving them. And I'd say the scale indicators, they're really coming through the results. We generated 350 basis points of margin expansion year over year while operating income rose 26%. And since the end of '22, BlackRock assets under management are up $3 trillion, while headcount is broadly flat.\\n\\nSo we're delivering the benefits of scale and productivity which is showing in our margin expansion. We continue to believe that technology, automation from footprinting are the major levers there for us to continue to drive that margin expansion. And the last thing I'd say is just market movements. Market movements beta, that's our highest margin item, both when markets move meaningfully up or down.\\n\\nAnd we continue to see conditions for reasonably positive growth in the markets over the near to intermediate term, so we believe we can continue to invest to accelerate organic growth and deliver margin expansion using this financial rubric that we've laid out.\\n\\nI'm good. Thanks. Question for you guys on private markets. There's a couple of topics.\\n\\nBut maybe starting with GIP, helpful to maybe just to get a mark to market on some of the financial elements. I know, Martin, you talked about $250 million, I think, in management fee in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving into 2025? What are some of the kind of fund flow dynamics on the legacy GIP side? And what are some of the things that you guys are working with them together? And also, if you could just remind us what the operating margin on that business is as well out of the gate as well.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Alex. So just the closing of GIP, it's a great milestone in BlackRock's history. We're really excited to welcome over 400 new colleagues to welcome the leadership team, Adebayo, Raj, Michael, Jon, everybody. Our clients are excited.\\n\\nThe consultants that we've been working with are excited. The corporate partners are excited, so we're really eager to partner on this new platform. And the reception, as Larry mentioned, has been overwhelmingly positive. For us, this is a revenue growth story.\\n\\nThis is about expanding capabilities. We're working to unlock substantial growth synergies across origination, capital formation, and platform scale. We're seeing excellent momentum in fundraising for -- across the platform at GIP, at BlackRock and have, I'd say, really strong ambitions, especially around the AI innovation fund that Larry mentioned. As I mentioned on the call -- in my earlier remarks, we're consolidating $116 billion of GIP AUM -- client AUM, $70 billion of fee-paying AUM.\\n\\nWe're doubling private markets run-rate management fees at BlackRock in the transaction, think about GIP adding, as we said on the call, annualized north of $400 million of earnings at sort of 50-ish percent margins. $250 million in management fees, we expect to come in the fourth quarter. So I'd model sort of $1 billion of fees with an FRE margin north of 50% when we think about 2025 in terms of GIP.\\n\\nOK, great. Sorry about that. I was hoping you could discuss your appetite for additional M&A. And what constraints you have financially, but more importantly, as a management team to appropriately integrate the recent deals and really maximize the opportunity you have with these transactions?\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAll right. Thanks so much for the question. As I said, we're really excited for our clients about GIP and Preqin. This is a meaningful acceleration in our private markets' capabilities.\\n\\nAnd I think just as I mentioned in the last question, it's a major financial contributor for BlackRock, but it's going to take some work to integrate well and realize the planned synergies of this transaction. So right now, we're very focused on integrating GIP and closing Preqin, and we're focused on delivering a great integration experience for clients and employees. We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business, and inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets. Look at this quarter.\\n\\nWe've hit our 5% organic base fee growth target, and we see excellent momentum. So we'll continue to be prudent with our capital and financial position. And consistent with our long-term approach, we'll evaluate inorganic opportunities that have the benefit for our clients and shareholders. We're always going to be very rigorous and selective in those criteria and entertain possibilities that have clear alignment with our culture, strategy, and long-term organic growth.\\n\\nWe have great capabilities here, Dan. So across infrastructure now, we've got $170 billion platform. We have an $85 billion private credit platform. We have a huge opportunity to grow inorganically in private credit with our insurance clients.\\n\\nWe're the largest core fixed-income manager in the world for insurance companies with organic. We're the largest organic opportunity to grow organic opportunity to grow with our insurance clients. We manage $700 billion of insurance company general account assets for them. So if you think about the conversations we're having with CIOs to integrate our private credit capabilities into that GA, if we can just flip -- if we can flip 10% of the $700 billion into private credit strategies, that's $70 billion of opportunity sitting with existing clients with the capabilities that we have today.\\n\\nThanks very much. So I think we're all pretty impressed with the broad growth that you keep putting up and huge margins, too, so I want a high-level question. You mentioned the word multiple expansion once or twice during the conversation, and just I think earnings growth needs to be part of the equation, too. And you have strong growth in everything.\\n\\nYou have big margins. I'm just curious why 5% EPS growth this quarter. Should we expect these initiatives as they layer in and you consistently hit the targets to actually bring the earnings growth along with it, too? I appreciate that.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks so much for the question, Glenn. So we're focused on driving differentiated organic growth, meeting our 5% organic growth targets through the cycle, driving operating leverage. And as you said, I think you see those results very much coming through. We think if we are able to drive 5% organic growth, continue to execute on this financial rubric I laid out, we should be able to drive industry-leading margins and margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth.\\n\\nI think in the quarter, I mentioned our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter. And that's the main driver between some of that lighter EPS here was the $22 million of discrete expense that we had in this quarter versus the $215 million of benefit that we had last year from discretes.\\n\\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.\\n\\nMaybe just back to the 5% organic base fee growth and maybe a different angle on this in terms of the fee rate. Obviously, the rate's going up with the GIP acquisition of that 0.5 to 1 basis point. Do you feel better now than you have maybe in a long time on the potential for the fee rate to either be stable or even move up sequentially in the next several years versus the fee pressure that you've seen? And I know that's all been due to mix in the past. But now the composition of your future organic growth seems to be tilted more toward the private markets, toward higher fee products versus obviously some of the lower mandates that you've been bringing in and also the core iSeries -- iShares, of course, your iShares, sorry.\\n\\nSo bottom line is do you feel better about that fee rate growth potential? And maybe if you can just touch on the model portfolios partnership as well in terms of the organic growth potential there.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely. Thanks so much for the question. So we generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, so 5% annualized organic base fee growth. We're excited about that.\\n\\nContinue to see great momentum just in our organic growth. We're growing revenues and operating income at double-digit rates and expanding margin. Average AUM growth was 18% higher than base fee growth, and that was mainly due to relative outperformance of lower fee rate U.S. equities or what you all in our analyst community would call divergent beta.\\n\\nSo spot AUM of $11.5 trillion ended the quarter about 4% higher than average AUM, and so our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis points lower sequentially. More macro just on the fee rate. On our AUM, the fee rate, it's a backward-looking output basically of the mix of the stock of assets that we manage and net new flows and net new fields on the fee rate. It's primarily affected by beta and FX and also by organic growth.\\n\\nAnd so over more recent periods, U.S. public equity markets, which are a lower fee rate segment, they've grown faster than international equities, and that's been a driver of these fee rate trends on our platform. And in those environments, strong U.S. equities, also the new base fee growth tends to occur at relatively lower fields to international or EM equities.\\n\\nFee rate for us, it's primarily an output. It's not the basis or driver of the strategy. We're focused on meeting client needs across the whole portfolio. We're focused on technology.\\n\\nWe're focused on driving organic growth in the most efficient way possible, but I do think you're grabbing on the point that we see, which is, as we grow our private markets business, and we're going to go from $170 billion of client AUM with GIP to, call it, $285 billion of client AUM. As we grow our private markets business, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue. We'd expect to see positive leverage to average fee rates and organic growth over time. Going into Q4, ex GIP, we'd expect the entry rate to be flat.\\n\\nAnd as I noted, consolidation of the GIP portfolios into our business is expected to lift the fee rate by about 0.5 to 1 full basis point. So in the longer term, as we see illiquids in private markets is a bigger contributor to our business mix, we would expect that to have positive leverage on the fee rate.\\n\\nOK. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Happy anniversary.\\n\\nI think I was there at the beginning, had to say. Indeed, I remember that meeting like it was yesterday. So a question for you. I was very intrigued by your statement about revolutionizing the wealth management opportunity.\\n\\nI was wondering if you could maybe unpack that a little bit. I think you mentioned that the whole portfolio opportunity could be better than everything on the evergreen side to date. And just wondering if you could expand your thinking a little bit, just so we get a sense of the magnitude and the opportunity and maybe any go-to-market strategy we should be thinking about as we look into the new year.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Bill. Very much appreciate the question. So we have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. Our aim is to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private markets exposures.\\n\\nI think if you go back to the last several investor days we've had, we've talked about building the -- we're talking about building the portfolio of the future for wealth managers, which is digitally enabled. It's public-private. And this market, I think, is still very early. Retail allocation to private markets still remains in low single digits.\\n\\nJust on capabilities for us here, we have a great established leading franchise in retail liquid alternatives. We've got over $40 billion of assets here across merger arb, systematic, multi-strategy, commodity exposures. We've had a lot of success in bringing retail alts to retirement in the U.K. and Europe through the LTIP and LTAP restructures.\\n\\nWe've been building out our evergreen and credit interval funds here in the United States. We have a credit strategies interval fund. We have a nontraded credit BDC B debt, which are combined to be over $1 billion today. BDC's well placed for RIAs, independent broker-dealers, offshore wealth, and we think this can be a strong grower for us.\\n\\nBut as you said, longer term, our aspiration is to integrate semi-liquid products into our over $300 billion managed models and SMAs. That would be the most significant unlock, and we feel competitive advantage we have. It's at the heart of the models venture that we've entered into with Partners Group. But I'd say it's consistently.\\n\\nIt's part of the partnerships we have with Envestnet, with GOL, with iCapital, with Case, with Vestmark. Our goal is to make model portfolios seamless in terms of public-private in the same way we've been able to do that in the same way that we've been able to do that with ETF and mutual fund active model portfolio. So we have a lot more work to do on that, but we're excited about the opportunity.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nBill, let me add more to that answer. As we believed when we acquired BGI that ETFs would become the instrument of so much of the activity in the capital market, and it's certainly been that way. Even in 2012, when we said ETFs are going to be expanding heavily in fixed income, to the surprise of so many people, and we crossed $1 trillion of that. What we are seeing now in private markets is a blending of public and private, and that's going to continue to blend.\\n\\nInstitutional clients are going to be looking at measurements of liquidity, and they're going to be trading in between public and privates, and that will become the new domain. And so we're not going to look at private markets in the same way like -- we're not going to say they're alternatives. They're just part of the marketplace itself. And one of the reasons why we were so driven to acquire Preqin, we believe that data and analytics will accelerate that movement of making public and private ubiquitous together.\\n\\nAnd what we're going to look at is liquidity as the driver of risk as we're going to be blending liquidity from the public markets, the liquidity, the private markets and making risk assessments. And if through the data analytics that we could have combining Preqin, Aladdin, and eFront, if we could build that platform into more transparency in privates, more opportunities for privates, this idea of the blending in public and privates will become a reality, just like the reality of how ETFs became the driving forces of so many of the markets now, and we believe that will happen, too. But it's going to happen with the acceleration of data and analytics. So when we -- when you think about these retail platforms that will be driving more private type of exposures, it will accelerate only when we have better data analytics, transparency, indexing, and that is a major component of our strategy going forward.\\n\\nGood morning, and thank you for having me on the call. Wanted to ask about your ambitions in digital assets to maybe changed up a little bit. It seems like one way or another, we're going to have a new president next year who's going to be more friendly to the industry, and it could take some time to see new rules and regulations. I'm just wondering, what do you see as the key opportunities for BlackRock that this change in posture from Washington could unlock sort of beyond the ETF business and some of the other custody things you do? Thank you.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, first, I'm not sure either president -- or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide. Conversations we're having with institutions worldwide, conversations about how should they think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be. I mean, we believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.\\n\\nIt is an alternative to other commodities like gold, and so I think the application of this form of investment will it be expanded to the role of the cerium as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded. And I truly don't believe it's a function of regulation -- of more regulation, less regulation. I think it's a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you -- years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred, started off very slow.\\n\\nBut it built as we build better analytics and data and then to better analytics and data, more acceptance, and a broadening of the market. And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets. And then we'll see how do -- does each and every country look at their own digital currency, but that's a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself. But I do believe the -- what we're going to witness as we build out better analytics.\\n\\nAnd then the question is, as you mentioned, regulation. How do we see in this country the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play? That's a very different question related to like, let's say, Bitcoin and other items like that, but all of that is going to be under discussion. And what we're witnessing in other countries that we're seeing big success in India and Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons. But we believe the technology of these blockchains are going to become very additive.\\n\\nAnd then you overlay AI and having better data analytics, the applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur.\\n\\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious whether you all have seen any changes in the RFP activity on the fixed income side? There's recently been some regulatory issues at a large institutional bond manager, so kind of curious about what you're seeing in the market there on the back of that.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo if you look at our announcement this quarter, we announced we won a $30 billion mandate from a pension fund. There are -- it is not uncommon to see big, large changes in the marketplace. I don't want to talk about one client or another client or what's happening with one manager versus another manager. There is no question money is in motion.\\n\\nRob Kapito talked about this a lot. We are seeing this. There's a very large institutional mandates that are going to be up for that there's an RFP right now, and so I don't look at this as any different. Obviously, there are some issues around that are in the press, but money in motion occurs every quarter.\\n\\nThere are large opportunities every quarter. And I think one thing that we see consistently as OCIO mandates occur, they're occurring with more regularity and with more opportunity, and this is away from the topic that you brought up. But it's important to just note this is not uncommon seeing large blocks of business moving around, and I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAt this time, this does conclude today's Q&A session. And I'd like to turn the call back to Larry Fink for any additional or closing remarks.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock over these last 25 years. Our third quarter results are possible because of the global network of relationships we've created, our data and analytics that are differentiated by all imagination, and importantly, our integrated technology that we've built over many, many years. We have a long history of good integration, whether it's the integration of BGI, Malin, Aperio, eFront.\\n\\nAnd now we're working on a successful close and integration of GIP, and we expect the same thing of a closing and integration of Preqin around year end. And I believe our position has never been better. And I believe as we look forward to delivering strong performance for our clients, we will create differentiated growth for you, our shareholders, in the coming years ahead. Everybody, thank you, and have a nice positive quarter.\",\n",

The global small business loan market was valued at $2.46 trillion in 2023 and is estimated to reach $7.22 trillion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 13.0% from 2024 to 2032.\\n\\nDownload Research Report Sample & TOC : https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A324248\\n\\nPrime determinants of growth\\n\\nThe global small business loan market is experiencing growth due to several factors such as the increasing number of start-ups and small businesses, the growing availability of distinct loan options tailored to meet the unique needs of small businesses, and the rising technological revolution in lending processes. However, the stringent loan approval processes for small businesses, high compliance costs for lenders, and limited financial literacy among small business owners hinder market growth to some extent. Moreover, the increasing government support to small businesses through loan guarantee programs, along with the surge in focus on expanding accessibility to credit for underserved populations offers remunerative opportunities for the expansion of the global small business loan market.\\n\\nReport coverage & details:\\n\\nReport Coverage Details Forecast Period 2024-2032 Base Year 2023 Market Size in 2023 $2.46 trillion Market Size in 2032 $7.22 trillion CAGR 13.0% No. of Pages in Report 250 Segments covered Loan Type, Tenure, Application, and Region Drivers Increasing number of start-ups and small businesses Growing availability of distinct loan options tailored to meet the unique needs of small businesses Rising technological revolution in lending processes Opportunities Increasing government support to small businesses through loan guarantee programs Surge in focus on expanding accessibility to credit for underserved population Restraints Stringent loan approval processes for small businesses High compliance costs for lenders\\n\\nInquire Before Buying: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/A324248\\n\\nThe small loans segment is expected to grow faster throughout the forecast period.\\n\\nBased on the loan type, the small loan segment held the highest market share in 2023, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the global small business loan market revenue and is likely to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period. The demand for small loans is driven by the growing need for managing short-term financing to manage cash flow, purchase inventory, and cover operational expenses, along with the growing number of business renovation and upgrade projects. Further, the rise of fintech companies and alternative lending platforms has made it easier for small businesses to access small loans, resulting in a significant growth prospect for the small loan segment.\\n\\nThe mid-term loan segment is expected to grow faster throughout the forecast period.\\n\\nBased on the tenure, the mid-term loans segment held the highest market share in 2023, accounting for about two-fifths of the global small business loan market revenue and is likely to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period. This can be attributed to the fact that small businesses may require medium-term loans to refinance existing debt or restructure their liabilities. This facilitates a reduction in monthly payments, securing lower interest rates, or extending the repayment period to improve cash flow management. Moreover, the growing need for equipment financing and the rising focus on improving financial forecasting are anticipated to drive down the demand for the mid-term loans market.\\n\\nThe small business segment is expected to garner faster throughout the forecast period.\\n\\nBased on the application segment, the small business segment held the highest market share in 2023, accounting for almost three-fifths of the global small business loan market revenue, and is likely to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period. The increasing focus of small businesses in real estate and infrastructure investments, along with the ongoing trend of economic diversification strategies. As economies diversify, small businesses are emerging in new sectors, such as renewable energy, tech startups, and specialized manufacturing. These sectors often require significant initial investment, increasing the demand for loans. However, the small business segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR between 2023 and 2032, owing to the globalization trends, supportive regulatory frameworks, and technological developments to compete more effectively with the larger firms.\\n\\nNorth America to maintain its dominance by 2032\\n\\nBased on region, North America held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2023, accounting for almost two-fifths of the global small business loan market revenue, and is expected to rule the roost in terms of revenue throughout the forecast timeframe. The growth is primarily driven by the growing entrepreneurial culture and the rise of startup businesses in this region. Moreover, the rise of alternative lending institutions, including peer-to-peer lenders and online loan providers, has expanded the availability of credit to small businesses, which may fuel market development in this region. In addition, supportive government policies and economic expansion initiatives are anticipated to contribute to industry growth across North America.\\n\\nPlayers: -\\n\\nAmerican Express Bank of America Bluevine Inc.

      "    \"body\": \"Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. third quarter 2024 earnings teleconference.\\n\\nOur host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer Martin S. Small, President Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel Christopher J.\\n\\nMeade. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\\n\\nChristopher J. Meade -- General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer\\n\\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the general counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.\\n\\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\\n\\nDon't miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \\\"Double Down\\\" stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\\n\\nRight now, we're issuing \\\"Double Down\\\" alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\\n\\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results.\\n\\nOur earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. On our previousearnings call we spoke to improving client sentiment and steadily improving organic growth. We sounded optimism about our growth trajectory in the second half of the year.\\n\\nAnd in the third quarter, organic growth surged, and BlackRock delivered some of the best financial results in our history. We generated $221 billion of net inflows, our highest net flows quarter ever. We delivered record levels of quarterly revenue and operating income. We expanded our margin by 350 basis points year over year.\\n\\nWe generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest quarter in three years. Organic growth is accelerating as we execute on a strong pipeline, and clients turn to BlackRock to move in size into public and private markets. Our structural growers, iShares; whole portfolio outsourcing, Aladdin, the structural growers all delivered strong third quarter growth and are poised to accelerate into year end. iShares.\\n\\niShares is leading the industry in global flows with approximately $250 billion through the third quarter and historically sees upwards of 40% of its total annual flows in Q4. Fixed-income ETFs, built cheaply on organic growth. iShares' fixed-income ETF assets now stand at over $1 trillion, nearly 40% higher than at year-end 2021. And Aladdin.\\n\\nAladdin logs 15% ACV growth, consistent with our long-term low to mid-teens target with excellent momentum and key wins with growing clients. Finally, fixed income. Fixed income delivered across the platform with over $60 billion of net inflows. We believe the continued path of central bank normalization will support sustained inflows across bond funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts.\\n\\nFixed income remains a compelling organic growth opportunity for BlackRock. Private markets are a strategic priority for BlackRock, delivering world-class private markets capabilities to more deeply serve clients across the whole portfolio. On October 1, we closed on our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. The combination triples infrastructure AUM and doubles private markets run-rate management fees.\\n\\nWe're already seeing the power of BlackRock and GIP together. Our partnership with Microsoft and MGX. It aims to realize the enormous investment potential of infrastructure to support AI innovation, and it's just the first proof point of the growth synergies we can create together. We're bringing private markets to wealth clients.\\n\\nBlackRock manages more than $300 billion of assets across model portfolios and separately managed accounts for wealth managers. These portfolios would benefit from increased exposure and more efficient access to the private markets. We believe the model portfolio solution we're building with Partners Group will revolutionize access to private markets for wealth managers and improve portfolio outcomes for millions of households on an even bigger scale than what's been done with evergreen funds. And as long observed in markets, information about capital has become almost as important as capital itself.\\n\\nOur planned acquisition of Preqin is accelerating this exciting private markets data and analytics journey for BlackRock and our clients. Our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients through access to unique opportunities, expertise, and world-class client service. We're also moving swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to continue to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. We're building our mix toward higher secular growth areas, like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates, and model portfolios.\\n\\nWe believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater diversification, and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Successful execution of these goals should also result in multiple expansion for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with AUM near $11.5 trillion, 11.5 trillion units of trust clients building with BlackRock. Our business tends to be seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and we maintain line of sight into a broad, global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel organic growth.\\n\\nBlackRock generated total net inflows of $221 billion in the third quarter, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth. Third quarter revenue of $5.2 billion was 15% higher year over year, driven by 5% organic base fee growth, the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months, and alpha generation in our liquid alternative strategies. Operating income of $2.1 billion was up 26% year over year. Earnings per share of $11.46 increased 5%, reflecting a higher tax rate compared to a year ago.\\n\\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $108 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by gains linked to a minority investment and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 26%. The prior-year quarter included $215 million of discrete tax benefits, while the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $22 million of discrete expense. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024.\\n\\nThe actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $4 billion increased 9% year over year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic base fee growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 4%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis points lower compared to the second quarter.\\n\\nThis was due to the relative outperformance of lower fee U.S. equity markets and client preferences for lower fee U.S. exposures and lower securities lending. The closing of GIP added $116 billion of client AUM and $70 billion of fee-paying AUM on October 1.\\n\\nWe expect GIP to add approximately $250 million of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024. The GIP portfolios contribute competitive private market fee levels that are typically over 100 basis points. They add primarily long-dated, nonredeemable assets to BlackRock's overall business which further diversify our revenue and earnings mix. We expect these private market assets to positively impact BlackRock's overall effective fee rate by 0.5 to 1 full basis point.\\n\\nPerformance fees of $388 million increased significantly from a year ago, primarily reflecting strong alpha generation over the last 12 months from a hedge fund with an annual lock in the third quarter. Quarterly technology services revenue was down 1% compared to a year ago due to the prior-year quarter revenue impact of eFront on-premises license renewals for several large clients. Excluding this impact, technology services revenue would have increased approximately 9% year over year. Sequentially, technology services revenue was up 2%, reflecting successful client go-lives.\\n\\nAnnual contract value, or ACV, increased 15% year over year, driven by sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. In the third quarter, a large U.S. asset manager selected Aladdin to unify its investment management technology platform across public market asset classes. Our ACV results include the impact of this client announcement and a number of other new client mandates.\\n\\nOur results highlight the power of Aladdin as a unifying technology. Aladdin provides a highly scalable operating backbone to clients that's tailored to meet their needs. It enables new capabilities to drive top-line business growth for clients while also unlocking scale and efficiency. Clients recognize a direct positive impact to the bottom line.\\n\\nTotal expense was 8% higher year over year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 10% year over year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. G&A expense was up 8% year over year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend last year and higher professional services expense. Sales, asset, and account expense increased 6% compared to a year ago, driven by higher direct fund expense.\\n\\nDirect fund expense increased 7% year over year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM. Our as-adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was up 350 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue, significantly higher performance fees, and organic base fee growth. As markets improve, we've executed on our financial rubric, aligning controllable expense and organic growth, adding more resilience to our operating margin through greater variabilization of expenses and driving fixed-cost scale. This approach is yielding profitable growth and operating leverage.\\n\\nIn line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin, and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024, and we also expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. In line with this outlook, we would also expect Q4 core G&A to reflect execution of planned technology investment spend at levels more consistent with Q3 and seasonal increases in marketing spend. We welcomed approximately 400 new colleagues to BlackRock following the close of the GIP transaction. Inclusive of the GIP acquisition impact, at present, we'd expect full-year core G&A expense growth to be closer to the high end of the previously communicated range of a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase.\\n\\nOur capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. At the closing of the GIP transaction, we issued and delivered approximately 6.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock, subject to a two-year lockup period. Approximately 30% of the total consideration for the transaction or 5 million shares is deferred and is expected to be issued in approximately five years based on achievement of certain performance milestones.\\n\\nWe repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance. At present, we expect our planned acquisition of Preqin to close around year-end 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. BlackRock's third quarter net inflows of $221 billion were well diversified and positive across client type, product type, active and index, and regions.\\n\\nMomentum in our ETFs continue to build with $97 million of net inflows in the third quarter. Fixed income and core equity led net inflows of $48 billion and $32 billion, respectively. Precision ETFs had $20 billion net inflows as clients efficiently adjusted tactical portfolio allocations would tilt toward U.S. and international developed market equities.\\n\\nBlackRock's cryptocurrency ETPs continue to grow and added $5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Institutional clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with BlackRock, and our institutional franchise raised $56 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Our institutional active franchise saw $27 billion net inflows, primarily in fixed income and multi-asset. Flows benefited from the funding of several large insurance and pension outsourcing mandates.\\n\\nWe also saw positive flows into systematic equity, LifePath target date offerings, and private market strategies. Institutional index net inflows of $29 billion reflected large mandate wins and client-specific asset allocation and rebalancing decisions. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio and inflows into U.S. active fixed income mutual funds.\\n\\nFixed income flows were positive across our municipal bond, high yield, unconstrained, and total return franchises. Demand for our illiquid alternative strategies continued in the third quarter with $1.5 billion of net inflows, driven by infrastructure and private credit. Net inflows also reflected the impact of successful realizations of over $3 billion, primarily from private equity and infrastructure strategies. Finally, cash management saw net inflows of $61 billion in the quarter, driven by both U.S.\\n\\ngovernment and international prime funds, and included multiple large new client mandates. Clients recognize the benefits of our scaled and integrated cash offerings, and this is contributing to sizable inflows of BlackRock. BlackRock delivered one of the strongest quarterly results in our history, and we're in an excellent position to grow with our clients moving ahead into the end of the year and beyond. BlackRock's historically delivered outsized organic growth in periods of investor rerisking, around election cycles, and changes in central bank policy.\\n\\nThe fourth quarter has also been historically strong for inflows. So we're staying connected with our clients. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and to grow our share. As clients increasingly turn to BlackRock, we believe this will result in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage and earnings and multiple expansion over time.\\n\\nThank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, everyone has had a good summer and a really fun fall. Last week, we happened across two milestones on the same day. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock becoming a public company, and we closed our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners.\\n\\nWe're incredibly excited to officially welcome our GIP colleagues to the BlackRock family. We've enjoyed great connectivity with Adebayo and Raj and all the GIP founding partners and we look forward to Adebayo joining our board of directors this quarter. Reflecting on these milestones and those came before, I believe our relationships with clients, with corporations, and with other partners are the strongest they've ever been. The long-term connectors and our relationships span many years as holders of company debt and equity.\\n\\nOur position as a consistent long-term investor differentiates us from opportunistic capital. We are not transactional. We're effectively a perpetual capital, particularly through our index holdings. Those long-standing relationships underpinned by long-term ownership positions are unlocking differentiated partnerships, especially as we expand into private markets.\\n\\nWe founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them. BlackRock has grown as the capital markets have become a bigger and bigger part of the global economy. In my conversations with clients and policymakers around the world, I hear how more and more countries recognize the power of American capital markets and would like to build their own type of capital markets. Record government deficits and tighter bank lending means people, companies, and countries will increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirements, their business, and their economies.\\n\\nThe growth in prosperity-generating power of the capital markets will remain a dominant economic trend in the coming decades, and BlackRock will be an important player in that growth. The opportunities ahead as we have never -- are never been better than we've seen now. We see this through unique deals and partnerships with BlackRock at the center and are accelerating client activity. 2024 net inflows have already surpassed the full-year net inflows of both 2022 and 2023.\\n\\nThe asset we manage on behalf of our clients reached a new high, ending the third quarter at $11.5 trillion. AUM has grown $2.4 trillion or 26% over the last 12 months. In that time, clients have entrusted BlackRock with $456 billion of net assets, including a record $221 billion in the third quarter. Third quarter net inflows and corresponding organic base fee growth of 5% represents our highest level in the last three years, and 15% technology services ACV growth is also at a fresh high.\\n\\nOn our earnings calls earlier this year, we discussed with our shareholders our visibility to a strong pipeline. We shared how this would lead to accelerating organic growth in the second half, and we're seeing that in our results today. We continue to grow our pipeline across the breadth of Aladdin, investment management mandates, and we expect momentum to further build into year end and 2025. We are effectively leveraging our technology, our scale, and our global footprint to deliver profitable growth.\\n\\nQuarterly revenues and operating income both set new records, up 15% and 26%, respectively, year over year. And our 45.8% operating margin is up 350 basis points. Importantly, organic growth has been -- has great breadth and is diversified across BlackRock. For both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, flows were positive in active and index, across all asset classes, across all client types, and across all regions.\\n\\nActives have contributed $28 billion in the third quarter, including positive results in active equities. ETFs remain a secular growth driver, adding $97 billion of net inflows in the quarter and $248 million year to date. We're seeing a broadening of ETF adaptation globally, leading to increased levels of utilization which we believe will only continue. A number of significant whole portfolio institutional mandates funded in the quarter, and we continue to be chosen for large global solutions.\\n\\nLast month, we were selected as a fiduciary manager for a $30 billion Dutch pension fund with more than 30,000 members. Our performance, our technology, and our in-depth knowledge of local investment nuances increasingly make us the preferred partner for institutional clients. Many investors have large cash holdings, Money market industry assets are hitting new records in the quarter, including BlackRock's own cash position, which had $61 billion of net inflows. But investors will have to rerisk to meet their long-term return needs, and we see great opportunities for investors across a number of structural trends continue to build this.\\n\\nThese include rapid advancements in technology and AI and rewiring of globalization and the unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is exceptionally well-positioned in front of that $9 trillion of money market funds across the industry as it makes its way into public and private markets. We are connecting our clients to opportunities and working with them in an integrated whole portfolio lens to help them deploy their capital. We know our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working.\\n\\nBlackRock has become the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. Private markets are becoming increasingly important in the financing of the economy. Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets and powering economic growth. These dynamics are reshaping the landscape of how our clients invest and how they allocate capital within their portfolios.\\n\\nThroughout our history, we've never shied away from making big bets to better serve our clients. As we did when we created Aladdin, unlocking new markets through ETFs and pioneered whole portfolio advisory across active and index, we make coordinated investments to bring private market opportunities to our clients in a better way. By an enthusiasm for the planned integration of GIP and the closing of Preqin has exceeded our own high expectations. Our clients are excited to see how GIP and Preqin capabilities amplified by being part of BlackRock.\\n\\nThe private markets and the clients' allocation to them will continue to grow. Standardized, transparent private market data and analytics will be increasingly important. As with Aladdin, we believe we can add more value to Preqin as both a user and a provider of private market data and risk analytics. Aladdin expanded into new asset classes and markets as BlackRock and our own clients evolve, and we expect the same for Preqin.\\n\\nThe growth of private markets is underpinned by the continued rise of infrastructure. It presents a generational investment opportunity. Over the next 15 years, we'll need to invest $75 trillion to repair aging infrastructure to invest in new projects like data centers and decarbonization technology. The current cash flow inflation-protected return profile of infrastructure makes it an attractive sector for our clients.\\n\\nMost of them will represent investor savings for retirement. With the close of GIP, we are now offering our clients access to market-leading investment and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. Clients will benefit from our substantial scale as the second-largest private market infrastructure managers in the world with $170 billion in client assets, and we have differentiated performance. GIP brings a track record of well-timed and disciplined entries into strategic exits, having returned over $45 billion of capital to investors.\\n\\nWith higher rates, distributions to paid-in capital are a critical measure of success and where we are an industry leader. The combination of BlackRock infrastructure platform with GIP is already unlocking meaningful opportunity for our clients. We recently announced our partnership with Microsoft and MGX across the global AI infrastructure investment partnership. We'll make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet growing demand for compute power.\\n\\nWe'll also invest in energy infrastructures needed to create new sources of power for these facilities. Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructures like data centers and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity. BlackRock is uniquely positioned at the center of this opportunity through our long-standing relationships with corporates, including hyperscalers and energy suppliers and governments around the world. We look forward to be working with our stakeholders in this ecosystem to navigate opportunities and challenges while we also are delivering investment returns for our clients.\\n\\nThis partnership is a powerful demonstration on how our expanded capabilities will enable us to do even more with our clients, investing in one of the largest growth imperatives in the coming decades. In addition to infrastructure, private credit is an important component of our clients' portfolio. We've grown our own broader private market private debt business organically and inorganically in recent years. Today, we manage over $85 billion and diversified across lending, investment-grade private placements, infrastructure, and real estate debt.\\n\\nAnd we've been a top 10 fundraiser over the last decade. BlackRock's nearly $4 trillion in assets across public fixed income, cash, and private credit means we both provide integrated fixed-income solutions for our clients and deliverable scale benefits. Our scale enhance our proprietary deal sourcing, access to the execution of deal flow, deeper liquidity, lowering trading costs, all of which benefits each and every one of our clients. Private markets have mainly been accessible to institutional investors, while private wealth holdings underweight by comparison.\\n\\nFor many wealth investors, the addition of private markets to the portfolio may provide diversification benefits to better returns. To help bridge this gap, we recently announced a partnership with the Partners Group to develop a first-of-its-kind private markets model portfolio solution. We believe it will transform retail access by enabling financial advisors and their clients to add broad-based exposures to the private markets, including to the BlackRock funds. We continue to innovate new investment strategies to improve private market access for our clients backed by our own investment expertise, our proprietary sourcing of deals, and our technology.\\n\\nAs market complexities and opportunities grow, clients need to scale enablers like Aladdin. Clients use Aladdin to consolidate a patchwork of legacy technologies, resulting in greater and better business agility and resilience. It combines risk management, the investment book of record, its performance, its accounting, its risk, and data all in one platform. Clients' research shows that Aladdin's scalable capabilities allow clients to grow faster, operate more efficiently, better risk management with our technology spend over the long term.\\n\\nThe power of Aladdin is resonating with both asset owners and managers. The ACV growth reflected several significant client mandates, including a large public asset manager and one of our largest Aladdin assignments ever. Aladdin is core to the consistent performance our portfolio managers deliver for clients. We leverage our investment insights and technology to bring the performance they demand and deserve.\\n\\nFlows into BlackRock Active strategies accelerated in the third quarter with $28 billion of net inflows, bringing our year-to-date total of $39 billion. This includes demand for active equities led by our high-performing quant strategies, where more than 90% of the AUM is above the one-, three- and five-year period. Across asset classes, investment performance remains strong over the long run. This is resonating in our active flows, in our liquid performance fees, and performance positions us well for future growth.\\n\\nIndex ETFs are increasingly being used within active management, and the ETF structure is being used to pair the alpha generation of leading investors with the liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency offered by ETFs. These dynamics are contributing to client demand globally for iShares ETFs. BlackRock generated in the third quarter ETF net inflows of $97 billion. ETF flows were positive across all segments and major regions, including double-digit organic growth in Europe.\\n\\nThere's more to come with the fourth quarter, which typically brings our seasonally strongest period of the year. Our iShares fixed-income ETF platform recently crossed $1 trillion in assets. And stand alone, it would be a top 5 bond manager by itself. Assets have nearly doubled over the last five years.\\n\\nAll of that growth has been organic and mostly in a flat to down fixed-income beta environment. A more normalized relatively high-rate environment has the potential to encourage investors back even more into fixed income. We continue to innovate in our exchange-traded products to provide better access to markets. This quarter, we launched our Ethereum ETF, which has garnered more than $1 billion of net inflows in the first two months of trading and follows the successful launch of our Bitcoin product, which has now grown to $23 billion in its first nine months, and we will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.\\n\\nOn October 1, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading somewhere around $960. When we went public, it was with a belief in the importance of growth and the depth of the global capital markets. We wanted to share our success with a broader population of people investing for the future, including our employees.\\n\\nThat all still holds true today. Our relentless focus on clients, having a growth mindset, and a willingness to change and evolve has generated a compounded annual total return of over 20% for our shareholders since our IPO 25 years ago. BlackRock has exceeded the total return of the S&P 500 in 19 of those 25 years, representing a business model to serve all our stakeholders. We are better positioned than ever to serve our clients and to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come.\\n\\nI've never felt more optimistic in our positioning as I do today, even after 25 years of being a public firm and 37 years of being a firm. I want to thank all the BlackRock employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and serving our clients with excellence. And again, we welcome our new colleagues from the firm and clients from GIP.\\n\\nThank you. [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\\n\\nHey, good morning. Martin, So my question is on the net flow trajectory. From your broad-based client conversations and your current institutional and funded wind pipeline, do you expect the acceleration rerisking activity continue into next year, post the election? And if your long-term net flow strengthen or stay strong, given that they're already pretty strong in the third quarter, should we expect any outflows in your money market business which I know might be somewhat protected given the institutional scale?\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Craig, for the question. So new inflows are strong, as you said, very healthy on any and all of the measures we track. No question, Craig, we're winning share with our clients. The $221 billion of Q3 flows, they showed great breadth across the business, positive flows in U.S.\\n\\nactive fixed-income mutual funds, systematic equity, LifePath target date. Larry talked about just our long-term active business really shows resilience since 2019. I think we've had positive active flows in 18 of 23 quarters, so we just continue to have a very strong flow performance, 25% higher than full-year Q3, and we still have this seasonally strong Q4 ahead. So we feel like a very healthy trajectory on asset growth.\\n\\nIt's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things with clients. And I think for where we are in the cycle, BlackRock has always been a meaningful outperformer in rerisking period. So going back to previous election cycles or central bank action, if you look at BlackRock, we had outsized upside capture if that was in 2017, '18, '21, and we saw a very strong organic asset growth, as well as organic base fee growth, that was over our long-term targets. So we see that the market and we think the world is lining up for that with our clients.\\n\\nAnd then with respect to money markets, our business is largely institutional. It's been very durable. The $61 billion of flows that's come there, I think, have been good. The trajectory has been very strong this year.\\n\\nI think, Craig, when we look at it, our money market fund business is at $850 billion today. It's nearly 70% bigger than it was five years ago. Cash is a meaningful part of client portfolios, but we're seeing that sort of return to fixed income as well, which has been good for the flow trajectory.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would just add one thing is as the global capital markets become a larger player in the economic activity here in other places in the world, the opportunity for us and our positioning for us is fantastic. And that will allow the backdrop for better flows, more and more exciting opportunities.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nMichael Cyprys -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter here and great to see the meaningful operating leverage as well in the quarter. So just curious how you're pacing investment spend here into '25. How is that evolving? And what are some of the levers to drive margin in the 12 to 18 months? Maybe you can update us on where you are along the journey of variabilizing your expenses.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Mike. I appreciate. It's Martin. So just that contextually, right, our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate industry-leading differentiated organic growth to drive operating leverage and industry-leading margins and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy.\\n\\nWe've got a strong track record at BlackRock of investing in the business for growth and scale while also expanding profitability. It's not just about growth. It's about profitable growth over the long term. And so our growth comes from being very disciplined in making and managing continued investments in our business.\\n\\nWe've dubbed this our financial rubric, which I mentioned. We size our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variabilizing more expenses where we can, and we've made a lot of progress there. And most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed-cost scale, especially through investments in technology.\\n\\nWe've got a consistent track record of delivering industry-leading margins and improving them. And I'd say the scale indicators, they're really coming through the results. We generated 350 basis points of margin expansion year over year while operating income rose 26%. And since the end of '22, BlackRock assets under management are up $3 trillion, while headcount is broadly flat.\\n\\nSo we're delivering the benefits of scale and productivity which is showing in our margin expansion. We continue to believe that technology, automation from footprinting are the major levers there for us to continue to drive that margin expansion. And the last thing I'd say is just market movements. Market movements beta, that's our highest margin item, both when markets move meaningfully up or down.\\n\\nAnd we continue to see conditions for reasonably positive growth in the markets over the near to intermediate term, so we believe we can continue to invest to accelerate organic growth and deliver margin expansion using this financial rubric that we've laid out.\\n\\nI'm good. Thanks. Question for you guys on private markets. There's a couple of topics.\\n\\nBut maybe starting with GIP, helpful to maybe just to get a mark to market on some of the financial elements. I know, Martin, you talked about $250 million, I think, in management fee in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving into 2025? What are some of the kind of fund flow dynamics on the legacy GIP side? And what are some of the things that you guys are working with them together? And also, if you could just remind us what the operating margin on that business is as well out of the gate as well.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Alex. So just the closing of GIP, it's a great milestone in BlackRock's history. We're really excited to welcome over 400 new colleagues to welcome the leadership team, Adebayo, Raj, Michael, Jon, everybody. Our clients are excited.\\n\\nThe consultants that we've been working with are excited. The corporate partners are excited, so we're really eager to partner on this new platform. And the reception, as Larry mentioned, has been overwhelmingly positive. For us, this is a revenue growth story.\\n\\nThis is about expanding capabilities. We're working to unlock substantial growth synergies across origination, capital formation, and platform scale. We're seeing excellent momentum in fundraising for -- across the platform at GIP, at BlackRock and have, I'd say, really strong ambitions, especially around the AI innovation fund that Larry mentioned. As I mentioned on the call -- in my earlier remarks, we're consolidating $116 billion of GIP AUM -- client AUM, $70 billion of fee-paying AUM.\\n\\nWe're doubling private markets run-rate management fees at BlackRock in the transaction, think about GIP adding, as we said on the call, annualized north of $400 million of earnings at sort of 50-ish percent margins. $250 million in management fees, we expect to come in the fourth quarter. So I'd model sort of $1 billion of fees with an FRE margin north of 50% when we think about 2025 in terms of GIP.\\n\\nOK, great. Sorry about that. I was hoping you could discuss your appetite for additional M&A. And what constraints you have financially, but more importantly, as a management team to appropriately integrate the recent deals and really maximize the opportunity you have with these transactions?\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAll right. Thanks so much for the question. As I said, we're really excited for our clients about GIP and Preqin. This is a meaningful acceleration in our private markets' capabilities.\\n\\nAnd I think just as I mentioned in the last question, it's a major financial contributor for BlackRock, but it's going to take some work to integrate well and realize the planned synergies of this transaction. So right now, we're very focused on integrating GIP and closing Preqin, and we're focused on delivering a great integration experience for clients and employees. We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business, and inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets. Look at this quarter.\\n\\nWe've hit our 5% organic base fee growth target, and we see excellent momentum. So we'll continue to be prudent with our capital and financial position. And consistent with our long-term approach, we'll evaluate inorganic opportunities that have the benefit for our clients and shareholders. We're always going to be very rigorous and selective in those criteria and entertain possibilities that have clear alignment with our culture, strategy, and long-term organic growth.\\n\\nWe have great capabilities here, Dan. So across infrastructure now, we've got $170 billion platform. We have an $85 billion private credit platform. We have a huge opportunity to grow inorganically in private credit with our insurance clients.\\n\\nWe're the largest core fixed-income manager in the world for insurance companies with organic. We're the largest organic opportunity to grow organic opportunity to grow with our insurance clients. We manage $700 billion of insurance company general account assets for them. So if you think about the conversations we're having with CIOs to integrate our private credit capabilities into that GA, if we can just flip -- if we can flip 10% of the $700 billion into private credit strategies, that's $70 billion of opportunity sitting with existing clients with the capabilities that we have today.\\n\\nThanks very much. So I think we're all pretty impressed with the broad growth that you keep putting up and huge margins, too, so I want a high-level question. You mentioned the word multiple expansion once or twice during the conversation, and just I think earnings growth needs to be part of the equation, too. And you have strong growth in everything.\\n\\nYou have big margins. I'm just curious why 5% EPS growth this quarter. Should we expect these initiatives as they layer in and you consistently hit the targets to actually bring the earnings growth along with it, too? I appreciate that.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks so much for the question, Glenn. So we're focused on driving differentiated organic growth, meeting our 5% organic growth targets through the cycle, driving operating leverage. And as you said, I think you see those results very much coming through. We think if we are able to drive 5% organic growth, continue to execute on this financial rubric I laid out, we should be able to drive industry-leading margins and margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth.\\n\\nI think in the quarter, I mentioned our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter. And that's the main driver between some of that lighter EPS here was the $22 million of discrete expense that we had in this quarter versus the $215 million of benefit that we had last year from discretes.\\n\\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.\\n\\nMaybe just back to the 5% organic base fee growth and maybe a different angle on this in terms of the fee rate. Obviously, the rate's going up with the GIP acquisition of that 0.5 to 1 basis point. Do you feel better now than you have maybe in a long time on the potential for the fee rate to either be stable or even move up sequentially in the next several years versus the fee pressure that you've seen? And I know that's all been due to mix in the past. But now the composition of your future organic growth seems to be tilted more toward the private markets, toward higher fee products versus obviously some of the lower mandates that you've been bringing in and also the core iSeries -- iShares, of course, your iShares, sorry.\\n\\nSo bottom line is do you feel better about that fee rate growth potential? And maybe if you can just touch on the model portfolios partnership as well in terms of the organic growth potential there.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely. Thanks so much for the question. So we generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, so 5% annualized organic base fee growth. We're excited about that.\\n\\nContinue to see great momentum just in our organic growth. We're growing revenues and operating income at double-digit rates and expanding margin. Average AUM growth was 18% higher than base fee growth, and that was mainly due to relative outperformance of lower fee rate U.S. equities or what you all in our analyst community would call divergent beta.\\n\\nSo spot AUM of $11.5 trillion ended the quarter about 4% higher than average AUM, and so our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis points lower sequentially. More macro just on the fee rate. On our AUM, the fee rate, it's a backward-looking output basically of the mix of the stock of assets that we manage and net new flows and net new fields on the fee rate. It's primarily affected by beta and FX and also by organic growth.\\n\\nAnd so over more recent periods, U.S. public equity markets, which are a lower fee rate segment, they've grown faster than international equities, and that's been a driver of these fee rate trends on our platform. And in those environments, strong U.S. equities, also the new base fee growth tends to occur at relatively lower fields to international or EM equities.\\n\\nFee rate for us, it's primarily an output. It's not the basis or driver of the strategy. We're focused on meeting client needs across the whole portfolio. We're focused on technology.\\n\\nWe're focused on driving organic growth in the most efficient way possible, but I do think you're grabbing on the point that we see, which is, as we grow our private markets business, and we're going to go from $170 billion of client AUM with GIP to, call it, $285 billion of client AUM. As we grow our private markets business, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue. We'd expect to see positive leverage to average fee rates and organic growth over time. Going into Q4, ex GIP, we'd expect the entry rate to be flat.\\n\\nAnd as I noted, consolidation of the GIP portfolios into our business is expected to lift the fee rate by about 0.5 to 1 full basis point. So in the longer term, as we see illiquids in private markets is a bigger contributor to our business mix, we would expect that to have positive leverage on the fee rate.\\n\\nOK. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Happy anniversary.\\n\\nI think I was there at the beginning, had to say. Indeed, I remember that meeting like it was yesterday. So a question for you. I was very intrigued by your statement about revolutionizing the wealth management opportunity.\\n\\nI was wondering if you could maybe unpack that a little bit. I think you mentioned that the whole portfolio opportunity could be better than everything on the evergreen side to date. And just wondering if you could expand your thinking a little bit, just so we get a sense of the magnitude and the opportunity and maybe any go-to-market strategy we should be thinking about as we look into the new year.\\n\\nMartin Small -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Bill. Very much appreciate the question. So we have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. Our aim is to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private markets exposures.\\n\\nI think if you go back to the last several investor days we've had, we've talked about building the -- we're talking about building the portfolio of the future for wealth managers, which is digitally enabled. It's public-private. And this market, I think, is still very early. Retail allocation to private markets still remains in low single digits.\\n\\nJust on capabilities for us here, we have a great established leading franchise in retail liquid alternatives. We've got over $40 billion of assets here across merger arb, systematic, multi-strategy, commodity exposures. We've had a lot of success in bringing retail alts to retirement in the U.K. and Europe through the LTIP and LTAP restructures.\\n\\nWe've been building out our evergreen and credit interval funds here in the United States. We have a credit strategies interval fund. We have a nontraded credit BDC B debt, which are combined to be over $1 billion today. BDC's well placed for RIAs, independent broker-dealers, offshore wealth, and we think this can be a strong grower for us.\\n\\nBut as you said, longer term, our aspiration is to integrate semi-liquid products into our over $300 billion managed models and SMAs. That would be the most significant unlock, and we feel competitive advantage we have. It's at the heart of the models venture that we've entered into with Partners Group. But I'd say it's consistently.\\n\\nIt's part of the partnerships we have with Envestnet, with GOL, with iCapital, with Case, with Vestmark. Our goal is to make model portfolios seamless in terms of public-private in the same way we've been able to do that in the same way that we've been able to do that with ETF and mutual fund active model portfolio. So we have a lot more work to do on that, but we're excited about the opportunity.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nBill, let me add more to that answer. As we believed when we acquired BGI that ETFs would become the instrument of so much of the activity in the capital market, and it's certainly been that way. Even in 2012, when we said ETFs are going to be expanding heavily in fixed income, to the surprise of so many people, and we crossed $1 trillion of that. What we are seeing now in private markets is a blending of public and private, and that's going to continue to blend.\\n\\nInstitutional clients are going to be looking at measurements of liquidity, and they're going to be trading in between public and privates, and that will become the new domain. And so we're not going to look at private markets in the same way like -- we're not going to say they're alternatives. They're just part of the marketplace itself. And one of the reasons why we were so driven to acquire Preqin, we believe that data and analytics will accelerate that movement of making public and private ubiquitous together.\\n\\nAnd what we're going to look at is liquidity as the driver of risk as we're going to be blending liquidity from the public markets, the liquidity, the private markets and making risk assessments. And if through the data analytics that we could have combining Preqin, Aladdin, and eFront, if we could build that platform into more transparency in privates, more opportunities for privates, this idea of the blending in public and privates will become a reality, just like the reality of how ETFs became the driving forces of so many of the markets now, and we believe that will happen, too. But it's going to happen with the acceleration of data and analytics. So when we -- when you think about these retail platforms that will be driving more private type of exposures, it will accelerate only when we have better data analytics, transparency, indexing, and that is a major component of our strategy going forward.\\n\\nGood morning, and thank you for having me on the call. Wanted to ask about your ambitions in digital assets to maybe changed up a little bit. It seems like one way or another, we're going to have a new president next year who's going to be more friendly to the industry, and it could take some time to see new rules and regulations. I'm just wondering, what do you see as the key opportunities for BlackRock that this change in posture from Washington could unlock sort of beyond the ETF business and some of the other custody things you do? Thank you.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, first, I'm not sure either president -- or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide. Conversations we're having with institutions worldwide, conversations about how should they think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be. I mean, we believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.\\n\\nIt is an alternative to other commodities like gold, and so I think the application of this form of investment will it be expanded to the role of the cerium as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded. And I truly don't believe it's a function of regulation -- of more regulation, less regulation. I think it's a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you -- years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred, started off very slow.\\n\\nBut it built as we build better analytics and data and then to better analytics and data, more acceptance, and a broadening of the market. And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets. And then we'll see how do -- does each and every country look at their own digital currency, but that's a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself. But I do believe the -- what we're going to witness as we build out better analytics.\\n\\nAnd then the question is, as you mentioned, regulation. How do we see in this country the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play? That's a very different question related to like, let's say, Bitcoin and other items like that, but all of that is going to be under discussion. And what we're witnessing in other countries that we're seeing big success in India and Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons. But we believe the technology of these blockchains are going to become very additive.\\n\\nAnd then you overlay AI and having better data analytics, the applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur.\\n\\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious whether you all have seen any changes in the RFP activity on the fixed income side? There's recently been some regulatory issues at a large institutional bond manager, so kind of curious about what you're seeing in the market there on the back of that.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo if you look at our announcement this quarter, we announced we won a $30 billion mandate from a pension fund. There are -- it is not uncommon to see big, large changes in the marketplace. I don't want to talk about one client or another client or what's happening with one manager versus another manager. There is no question money is in motion.\\n\\nRob Kapito talked about this a lot. We are seeing this. There's a very large institutional mandates that are going to be up for that there's an RFP right now, and so I don't look at this as any different. Obviously, there are some issues around that are in the press, but money in motion occurs every quarter.\\n\\nThere are large opportunities every quarter. And I think one thing that we see consistently as OCIO mandates occur, they're occurring with more regularity and with more opportunity, and this is away from the topic that you brought up. But it's important to just note this is not uncommon seeing large blocks of business moving around, and I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAt this time, this does conclude today's Q&A session. And I'd like to turn the call back to Larry Fink for any additional or closing remarks.\\n\\nLarry Fink -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock over these last 25 years. Our third quarter results are possible because of the global network of relationships we've created, our data and analytics that are differentiated by all imagination, and importantly, our integrated technology that we've built over many, many years. We have a long history of good integration, whether it's the integration of BGI, Malin, Aperio, eFront.\\n\\nAnd now we're working on a successful close and integration of GIP, and we expect the same thing of a closing and integration of Preqin around year end. And I believe our position has never been better. And I believe as we look forward to delivering strong performance for our clients, we will create differentiated growth for you, our shareholders, in the coming years ahead. Everybody, thank you, and have a nice positive quarter.\\n\\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

      "    \"body\": \"Welcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\\n\\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\\n\\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Michael Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\\n\\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \\\"Double Down\\\" stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\\n\\nRight now, we're issuing \\\"Double Down\\\" alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\\n\\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights.\\n\\nOur results were solid with $5.1 billion of net income, diluted earnings per share of $1.42, and ROE of 11.7%, and an ROTCE of 13.9%. All were up from the second quarter. Our earnings profile is very different than it was five years ago as we've been making strategic investments in many of our businesses and deemphasizing or selling others. Our revenue sources are more diverse, and our fee-based revenue has grown 16% during the first nine months of the year, largely offsetting the net interest income headwinds we have faced over the last year.\\n\\nWe have maintained strong credit discipline and driven significant operating efficiencies in the company while investing heavily to build a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity. Headcount has declined every quarter for four years and was down 20% and since the third quarter of 2020. Our expenses in the third quarter were down from both the second quarter and a year ago. Average loans declined from the second quarter as we have maintained strong credit standards and our focus on returns over volume.\\n\\nWe've continued to grow our credit card portfolio with balances growing for 13 consecutive quarters, and commercial loan demand remains weak, reflecting economic uncertainty and the expectation that rates will be lower in the future. Overall deposits declined slightly from the second quarter, but deposit balances in our customer-facing businesses continue to grow, which has enabled us to reduce higher-cost treasury, corporate treasury deposits. We have started to reduce deposit pricing in response to the recent Fed rate cuts, and we're closely monitoring market conditions and will continue to make adjustments. Both our consumer and commercial customers have remained resilient.\\n\\nIn our wholesale businesses, credit performance improved from the second quarter with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. The office market remains weak, and we continue to expect additional charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio and have accordingly maintained strong allowance coverage. Overall, customers in our consumer businesses continued to hold up relatively well, benefiting from a strong labor market and wage growth. Consumer charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven by lower losses in our credit card portfolio, while our other consumer portfolios continue to perform well, reflecting the benefit of prior credit-tightening actions.\\n\\nWe continue to look for changes in consumer health, but we have not seen meaningful changes in trends when looking at delinquency statistics across our consumer credit portfolios. Both credit card and debit card spend were up in the third quarter from a year ago. And although the pace of growth has slowed, it is still healthy. We continue to see more pronounced stress in certain customer segments with lower deposit and asset levels where inflation has partially offset strong employment and wage growth.\\n\\nThe benefits of inflation slowing and interest rates starting to ease should be helpful to all customers but especially those on the lower end of the income scale. Our capital position remains strong with our CET1 ratio of 11.3%, up from 11% last quarter, and we continue to return significant amounts of excess capital to shareholders. We repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock in the quarter and $15.6 billion of common stock during the first three quarters of this year, up over 60% from a year ago, and we increased our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14%. Shareholders have meaningfully benefited from our capital management actions as our earnings per share are up over 50% since the third quarter of 2019, benefiting from the 22% decline in diluted average common shares over the same period.\\n\\nNow let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work, which remains our top priority. We continue to move forward with confidence and believe we have the right culture, team, discipline, and sense of urgency to complete the work that's required. That includes what is required under the recent formal agreement we entered with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We are also continuing to execute on our other strategic priorities.\\n\\nWe continue to build our credit card business. And this past quarter, we launched two new co-branded credit cards with Expedia which provide our customers a unique travel rewards program with instant discounts, enhanced perks, and accelerated rewards. Our broader set of credit card products continue to be well received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells Fargo with nearly 2 million new credit card accounts this year. Last month, we announced a multiyear co-branded agreement with Volkswagen Financial Services.\\n\\nStarting in the first half of next year, we will be the preferred purchase financing provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands in the United States. The investments we've been making in our consumer, small, and business banking segment are starting to generate growth. After several years of no growth, net check accounts have now grown for three consecutive quarters, and we believe our debit card share has started to increase as well. Mobile active users increased by 1.6 million or 5% from last year.\\n\\nWe are also investing in our branches and have refurbished over 460 branches during the first three quarters of this year. We continue to hire proven leaders in our corporate investment bank. In investment banking, we made several important hires focused on key coverage and product groups to help us build on our momentum and grow the business. We also hired a new vice chair of corporate banking, who is focused on helping us continue to expand and grow that franchise.\\n\\nWe also continue to attract experienced leaders in other areas. And in the third quarter, Bridget Engle joined Wells Fargo as head of technology reporting to me. I've worked with Bridget in the past and know firsthand how her deep experience, leading large-scale technology transformations of large global financial institutions will benefit Wells Fargo. Our strategic priorities also include focusing on businesses that are core to our consumer and corporate clients and when they aren't, shrinking, or selling them.\\n\\nAs part of this effort, during the third quarter, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third-party servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business. We will continue servicing agency loans and loans held on our balance sheet. Looking ahead, overall, the U.S. economy remains strong with inflation slowing and a resilient labor market, boosting income and supporting consumer spending.\\n\\nCompany balance sheets are strong, contributing to both consumption and investment in the economy but slowing demand for commercial lending. We continue to be prepared for a variety of economic environments, and we'll balance our desire to increase returns and grow while protecting the downside. We have one of the most enviable franchises in the industry and a top management team capable of delivering strong results. I want to thank everyone who I worked with at Wells Fargo for everything they've done to transform this great company.\\n\\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the results in the third quarter. We again saw good growth in noninterest income across most businesses and expenses were well controlled. Net income for the third quarter was $5.1 billion or $1.42 per diluted common share.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, we took the opportunity to reposition a portion of the investment securities portfolio. Our results included $447 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities. This included the sale of approximately $16 billion of securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into securities with yields approximately 130 basis points higher than the securities we sold. The estimated earn-back period for this repositioning is a little over two years.\\n\\nWithout the impact of the investment securities portfolio repositioning, earnings per share would have been $1.52. When looking at our results compared with a year ago, I'd remind you that our third quarter results last year included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits. Turning to Slide 4. Net interest income declined $233 million or 2% from the second quarter.\\n\\n$128 million of this decline was due to the increased pricing on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts and wealth and investment management that we highlighted on last quarter's call. This was the lowest linked-quarter decline in net interest income since third quarter 2023 as customer migration to higher-yielding deposit products continued to slow and the pace of deposit pricing increases also decelerated. Deposit costs were up 7 basis points in the third quarter with approximately half of this increase driven by the pricing increase on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. The third quarter increase in deposit costs was lower than the 10-basis-point increase in the second quarter and the 16-basis-point rise in the first quarter.\\n\\nIn response to the Federal Reserve rate cut in September, we have reduced rates on promotional deposit offers in our consumer businesses, pricing on sweep deposits, and advisory brokerage accounts which are aligned to money market funds will continue to move in line with Fed rate cuts. Commercial deposit pricing has responded quickly to Federal Reserve rate reductions, just as it did when rates were rising. We are continuously monitoring competitive conditions and deposit trends, and we'll adjust pricing, tenor, and de-balance requirements based on our observations. We highlight loans and deposits on Slide 5.\\n\\nAverage loans were down from both the second quarter and a year ago with continued growth in credit card loan balances more than offset by declines in most other categories. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits increased $1.4 billion from a year ago and growth in our customer deposits enabled us to reduce higher-cost corporate treasury deposits. Average deposits were down $4.8 billion in the second quarter.\\n\\nThis decline was driven by an $18.5 billion reduction in higher-cost corporate treasury deposits, while customer deposits grew $13.7 billion from the second quarter. All else equal, a reduction in corporate treasury deposits is a positive for net interest income in the current environment. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 6. We had strong growth in noninterest income, up 12% from a year ago.\\n\\nAs Charlie highlighted, this growth reflects the benefits of the investments we've been making in our businesses, as well as market conditions. We grew noninterest income across most categories, including double-digit increases year over year in many of our largest fee-generating activities, including investment advisory, net gains from trading activities, deposit-related fees, and investment banking. We also benefited from improved results in our venture capital investments. I will highlight the specific drivers of noninterest income growth when discussing our operating segment results.\\n\\nTurning to expenses on Slide 7. Noninterest expense declined from both the second quarter and a year ago. The impact of our efficiency initiatives helps reduce salaries and professional and outside services expense compared with a year ago. These declines were partially offset by higher revenue-related compensation predominantly in wealth and investment management, as well as higher technology and equipment expense.\\n\\nOperating losses declined from a year ago and from the higher levels we had in the first half of this year. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs decreased 8 basis points from the second quarter to 49 basis points of average loans. The decline was driven by lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $145 million from the second quarter to 24 basis points of average loans with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios.\\n\\nWhile losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio declined in the third quarter, market fundamentals remained weak, and we still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients. Consumer net loan charge-offs declined $45 million from the second quarter to 83 basis points of average loans, driven by lower losses in the credit card portfolio. Nonperforming assets decreased 3% in the second quarter, driven by lower commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Commercial real estate office nonaccruals declined $164 million, which included paydowns and net loan charge-offs.\\n\\nMoving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $50 million from the second quarter with modest declines across most asset classes, largely offset by an increase in allowance for credit card loans, driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for loans has been relatively stable over the past year as credit trends remain within our expectations. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% since third quarter of 2023.\\n\\nTurning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.3% continued to be well above our new CET1 regulatory minimum, plus buffers of 9.8%, which became effective in the fourth quarter. The increase in our CET1 ratio from the second quarter included a benefit of 28 basis points from higher accumulated other comprehensive income due to lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads. With the $3.5 billion of common stock repurchased in the third quarter, our share repurchases during the first three quarters of this year were $6 billion higher than the same period a year ago, and diluted average shares outstanding declined 7% from a year ago.\\n\\nTurning to our operating segment results, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 11. Consumer small and business banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. However, the pace of migration continued to slow. The slight increase in home lending revenue from a year ago was driven by higher mortgage banking fees.\\n\\nCredit card revenue declined 2% from a year ago as lower fee revenue more than offset higher net interest income. Auto revenue decreased 24% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was also driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12.\\n\\nRetail mortgage originations declined 14% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we've made on simplifying the home lending business but grew 4% from the second quarter. We also continue to make progress on reducing the size of our servicing business. The amount of third-party mortgage loan service was down 16% from a year ago. Since we announced our new strategy early last year, we reduced headcount at home lending by 46%.\\n\\nThe size of our auto portfolio continued to decline with period-end loan balances down 14% from a year ago, driven by previous credit tightening actions. Origination volume in the third quarter was stable year over year and grew 11% from the second quarter. Debit card spending increased $2.3 billion or 2% from a year ago, and credit card spending was up 10% from a year ago with growth in all categories, except fuel. Payment rates were modestly lower than a year ago but remained above pre-pandemic levels.\\n\\nTurning to commercial banking results on Slide 13. Middle-market banking revenue was down 1% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income and lease income, partially offset by improved results from our -- from equity investments. Average loan balances in the third quarter were down 1% compared with a year ago.\\n\\nLoan demand remained weak as many clients remain cautious about investing in inventory buildup and capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty and high borrowing costs. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue was down 5% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. Commercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances, partially offset by higher capital markets revenue.\\n\\nMarkets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in rates, structured products, and municipals, partially offset by lower revenue and equities. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by continued reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio and lower loan balances and banking as clients continue to access capital markets funding. On Slide 15, wealth and investment management revenue increased 5% compared with a year ago due to higher asset-based fees, driven by increased market valuations, as well as higher brokerage transaction activity, partially offset by lower net interest income, driven by the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts. As a reminder, the majority of advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were up from both a year ago and from July 1.\\n\\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined a year ago, driven by net losses on debt securities related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by improved results from our venture capital investments. Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on Slide 17. We currently expect fourth quarter 2024 net interest income to be roughly in line with the third quarter of 2024, which would imply an approximately 9% decline in full-year 2024 net interest income compared with 2023.\\n\\nBased on this expectation, we believe we are close to the trough. However, exactly when the securities will be influenced by a variety of factors, including the pace of Fed rate changes, deposit mix and pricing, and day count. Turning to expenses. We still expect full-year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately $54 billion, which has not changed from our guidance last quarter.\\n\\nAs a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. In summary, we had solid results in the third quarter, which demonstrated the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our returns. We grew noninterest income by 12% from a year ago with growth across most businesses. We achieved this double-digit growth even with the $447 million loss we took to reposition the investment securities portfolio which will start to benefit our results in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nWhile this growth in noninterest income was more than offset by an expected decline in net interest income, the investments we have made in our businesses drive better fee income, and diversify our revenue were evident. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with expenses down from a year ago and headcount down for 17 consecutive quarters. Our results also reflected our credit discipline and strong capital position which has enabled us to return more than $23 billion to shareholders over the past year through common stock, dividends, and share repurchases. And while we are pleased with the progress we've made, we are even more excited about the additional opportunity we have throughout all the businesses to continue to improve our results.\\n\\n[Operator instructions] The first question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Sir, please go ahead.\\n\\nScott Siefers -- Analyst\\n\\nMorning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to start with NII. So your fourth quarter number should be flattish with the third quarter level, and I believe you mentioned toward the end of your prepared remarks that you believe Wells is sort of close to the trough.\\n\\nI was hoping you could just unpack, please, a bit more what you see as the swing -- the main swing factors either way, as well as kind of what it might take from here for it to begin to inflect back up -- pardon me, back upward more visibly.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Scott. No, I appreciate the question. So I mean, it's the same drivers we've been talking about now for the last number of quarters. So obviously, deposits and the mix of those deposits is going to be a big factor in the near term.\\n\\nI think as you can see in our trend that NIB deposits were behaving pretty well. I will note, though, in the trend that there is a product switch conversion that we did that sort of impacted NIVs and IV. So if you take that out, the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits is effectively flat to the third quarter, and so that's the first time now in a while where we've seen that be the case. And so that's one of the factors that we'll have to see sort of play out for a little bit longer time period.\\n\\nBut so far, so good in terms of that trend participating in the way we thought or behaving the way we thought. Obviously, deposit pricing as rates come back down or is going to be a big factor. If you look at, as I said in my remarks, on the consumer side, we've already adjusted promo rates, as well as CDs. Those will continue to adjust as rates move.\\n\\nWe're seeing exactly what we thought we would see on the most interest rate-sensitive deposits on the commercial side as rates started to come down. The betas are exactly what we thought and are pretty high for those deposits. So that's working. Obviously, we haven't seen any loan growth, but we weren't expecting that, but that will be a factor as you sort of look a little bit -- over a little bit longer time period.\\n\\nAnd then this is a little bit in the weeds. But as you sort of look at the first quarter, you do have day counts and things to kind of adjust for. So you could bounce around a little bit depending on the quarter based on factors like that as well.\\n\\nScott Siefers -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Perfect. And then you touched -- I appreciate that. And then you touched on loan demand is a factor as well.\\n\\nYou all have been pretty reserved regarding that backdrop throughout the year, which has been borne out to be correct. I guess, hopefully, we're beginning to get some clarity on some of the unresolved issues like cost to borrow and I guess we're getting closer to the election. Maybe just some additional thoughts on the overall outlook there, if possible, please.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, I think -- I mean, you hit on a couple of the things that people are thinking about. But based on the conversations our teams are having with clients, I think people are still being very prudent about borrowing. I think the 50-basis-point reduction is helpful, but not by itself a factor that will drive people to borrow or not, I think they'll need to see that come down more meaningfully if that's like the driving force.\\n\\nThe uncertainty around the election, the uncertainty around the just macro backdrop, I think as people get more confidence that the baseline case of a soft landing will materialize, you get past the election, you see rates come down a little bit. I think all those things will come together and help give clients more confidence about either building inventories or making further capital expenditures that they're just -- they're holding off on now. So I think you got to see a few of those things come together. And as you say, as we get closer to the end of the year, you'll start to get a little bit more visibility there, and we'll see as it goes.\\n\\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\\n\\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, good morning. I guess first question, I think Charlie addressed this a little bit in his opening remarks around expenses, and I appreciate you're not talking about 2025 today. But big picture, looking at your Slide 7, personnel expenses, flat 8.6% year over year; noncomp, flat 4.2% year over year. From a shareholder perspective and given what you've said, is it fair to assume we continue to see some of this flat-lining trend where there are enough savings to reinvest in the platform, grow fee revenues, and do all the stuff that you're doing but without seeing a meaningful change in these two categories as we look forward?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThis is Charlie. I guess I'll just repeat what we've said in the past, which is we think that there continue to be meaningful efficiencies around the company, but we also are investing in both spending whatever we need to spend in the risk and regulatory space, as well as investing for the future. And when we get to next quarter, we'll talk about 2025. And we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves because that's something that we think we've done a good job of balancing historically, and we'll continue to balance it, going forward, in our thinking.\\n\\nAnd when we've got specifics to share, we'll share it.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd, Ebrahim, I'll just maybe point out one other thing. As you look at things like personnel expense, obviously, there's lots that go underneath that. So we are seeing the efficiency come through on salaries and other items, and that's offset by revenue-related expense, mostly in the wealth and investment management business. And so that's a good thing, right? So you may see that bounce around, but underneath that is the efficiency really coming through as headcount continues to come down, I think we both probably pointed it out that headcount came down again in the quarter.\\n\\nSo we're continuing to execute on that part of the efficiency agenda, as well as all the other non-personnel expenses. But again, I just -- I don't think our thinking has changed about efficiency opportunities but also opportunities to invest. We just need to go through our own internal process as we think about 2025. And when we finish that, we'll share it.\\n\\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\\n\\nThat's helpful. And just maybe one quick -- Mike, I'm sorry if I missed it on NII. It's an asset-sensitive balance sheet. We go to September, 50 basis points cut.\\n\\nI would have assumed fourth quarter NII would have declined, and maybe there's about $50 million of bond book restructuring help. Just why then NII not going down despite the 50 basis points? And is there more room for additional restructuring as we look forward? Thank you.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I mean, look, it's just a confluence of all the factors that come together right around sort of what's happening with the mix of deposits. Our mix is a little bit different obviously than others. I think the pricing actions we took across the deposit base help as you look into the fourth quarter as well.\\n\\nAnd then obviously, we've got assets continue to kind of reprice up. We've got the repositioning but also just normal reinvestment as we've seen maturities roll. I think on repositioning, we've been sort of repositioning the portfolio for a while, and we'll continue to look at it. Nothing on the horizon right now, but we'll continue to look at it as we always do, and we'll let you know if we decide to do more.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd the only thing I'd add is when you think about just rate movement, you need to look at the different points along the curve.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Good morning. My first question is could you remind us, based on your understanding, what happens next after you submit your third-party review to the Fed as it relates to the asset cap work stream?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, so just the way consent orders work, I'll answer it very generally because we don't talk about anything specific relative to where we are and what the timing is. We haven't and we won't, is you get a consent order. We need to do the work to develop a very detailed plan. The regulators then look at that plan and give us feedback on the plan.\\n\\nWe execute on that plan. And whatever is required in that submission when we're done with the work, we submit it to them. And then they have done some work along the way, but they generally do a review after the submission. And then they've got a series of formal processes that they need to go through to make the decision on whether the work has been done to their satisfaction.\\n\\nAnd when that's done, we find out about it, and you find out about it.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. OK. And just as a follow-up. You bought back $3.5 billion of shares in the third quarter.\\n\\nMike, is this about the -- this pace that we should expect until we get your next SCB in June? I'm just trying to think about framing the buyback opportunity over the next few quarters.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Erika. We don't really talk about quarter-to-quarter pace. But I think if you look at where we stand from a capital perspective, we're 150 basis points over the new reg minimum, plus buffers of 9.8%. So we go into this environment with plenty of excess capital.\\n\\nWe're going to generate more capital, obviously, through earnings as we go. And then we go through the normal process that we go through every quarter to look at sort of the opportunities we have to help support clients. We look at the risks that are out there, and then we'll decide on the exact pacing sort of as we go. But we're happy that we were able to buy back $15.5 billion so far year to date.\\n\\nAnd continuing to give excess capital back to shareholders is something that's top of mind for us.\\n\\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Good morning. So first question, just want to understand if the asset cap were to be removed -- well, I should say when the asset cap is removed, right? What -- are there opportunities for you to lean in anywhere in terms of asset growth? Because I've heard you in the past several times, and I would assume it's the same today that the asset cap is not keeping you from doing anything that you want to do. And maybe that's wrong, but I just want to understand where you would lean in if it -- when it does get removed.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Mike, I'll start, and then you can either amplify or change if you disagree with anything I say. I think what we see and what we have talked a little bit about is the places where we have been the most careful about the assets and our liabilities today is around. On the wholesale deposit side, there's certainly been places where we've had to be very careful about not bringing on significant deposits because we want to make sure that we've got the room to serve customers elsewhere, both relative to their borrowing needs, as well as consumer deposits.\\n\\nAnd obviously, when commercial deposits come in, it brings cash with it. The other place has been in our markets business where we actually -- since the asset cap has been in existence, we've not just limited but reduced somewhat the financing abilities that we have for our customers. So those are the two places where we'd probably see the impact immediately, not incredibly significant changes by any stretch of the imagination, but we've been -- had to be very, very careful in those two places. And then beyond that, it's just normal growth opportunities that we would see across all the different parts of the company.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the expense side, you've talked in the past about the $2.2 billion that has been invested to address the issues in the consent order and to deal with them. When the consent order goes away, is there an opportunity to pull back on that at all?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe're not even -- honestly, we literally aren't even thinking about that. We still have more work to do. We've said that that is the most important thing. At some point, can we become more efficient in some of the things? Absolutely.\\n\\nBut what's most important is from our standpoint to make sure that the things we've built become part of the culture of the company. So it's just not -- it's just -- when we think about efficiencies, we think about there are plenty of other places for us to drive efficiencies and not focus on those activities at this point.\\n\\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning. I was hoping you guys could talk about the anti-money laundering KYC, the disclosure in the 10-Q value investigation. And then there was some regulatory outcome on that and given that it was in your 10-Q and so public. Wondering if you could just add some color around it? And then also just what it might mean to expenses and anything else we should be mindful of going forward? Thank you.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I mean, we put out something when we entered into the formal agreement with the OCC. And like other things that we find and they find, we take them extremely seriously. We're going to get the work done.\\n\\nAs I've said in my prepared remarks, I think as we identify issues and we see that there are things that have to get built, we've got confidence that we've got the ability to do it. I would say, relative to the cost around it, I'd say the two different pieces, which is just like all of the control-related work, we're going to spend whatever is necessary. At this point, as we sit and look at the $54 billion expense base, don't see it having anything meaningfully that we need to talk about beyond our ability to spend as we've discussed. And I would also mention that, and I think we've said something about this, which is a significant amount of the work that is required in the consent order, we've been working on.\\n\\nAnd so as we think about what we're spending, we're spending a significant amount of money relative to what's necessary in that order already.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. And then are you able to comment is this kind of a Wells-specific thing or an industrywide kind of area focus because you know the banks are responsible not just for kind of policing their customers but really keeping track of all the money that is moving around. It seems like it could be a broader focus on that.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe're not going to speak -- we speak for ourselves and what we know. Beyond that is not right or appropriate.\\n\\nThe next question will come from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.\\n\\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up with the regulatory side. And can you remind us of the mechanics of the asset cap without providing any insight as to when you think it may come off? But can the asset cap be removed in your opinion without the consent order being removed completely?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nListen, I would -- for anyone who's -- if you have questions on the 2018 Fed consent order, it's very readable. It's something like -- I don't remember exactly, but it's like five pages -- seven pages, Mike is telling me of which there are like -- there's a page in there, which is really the page that lays out what we have to accomplish and how the Fed is going to look at things. So it really is very digestible. So I'll give you a brief summary.\\n\\nBut again, please, I'd point you back to it if you want to go through it. We're required to -- the board needs to be more effective. We need to build out operational risk and compliance in the company. There is -- to lift the asset cap, that work needs to be adopted and implemented and to lift the entire consent order needs to be effective and sustainable.\\n\\nAnd so that's what's laid out the way the Fed will interpret those things, and relative to things going on in the company is certainly in their bailiwick. As I've said, we're very focused on getting the work done and feel good about our ability to get it done, given what we've shown that we can do here.\\n\\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. Thank you, Charlie. Appreciate it. And then the other question I had was related to the trading gains line, and you've been putting up over $1 billion there per quarter in trading gains.\\n\\nWhat are some of the puts and takes in that line that can create some volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I'll -- it's Michael. I'll take that. Obviously, volatility in the market, a big factor.\\n\\nSo it's kind of the market conditions that we operate in. You generally have some seasonality to that line item, as well in the third and fourth quarter as you get to the holiday season. And then I think where we've been focused there is really just continuing to methodically improve the capabilities, make sure we got the right people in the right seats. We continue to improve our -- all of our technology and e-trading capabilities.\\n\\nAnd we're seeing good results of that, but it's something that can move around based on market conditions quite a bit, but our focus is just to make sure that we continue to have the right capabilities to serve clients. And we've been pleased now that we've strung together probably seven quarters of pretty good performance there, and we'll look forward to happens going forward.\\n\\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning. Just around the -- a little bit more around the securities repositioning, how much of a benefit to net interest income did the securities repositioning have this quarter? And how much of a -- would it be a full-quarter impact that you would expect for the fourth quarter?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nVery little in the third quarter. It's all done. So it's in the run rate for the fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. And then have you sized up that impact? And what it would mean for NII for the fourth quarter?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt's in the -- in my remarks where we did about $16 billion of repositioning. We picked up about 130 basis points on that. So I mean, obviously, you got to go day count and other things to adjust, but it's pretty easy to model.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nRight. OK. All right. And then separately, just around the fee income commentary, I appreciate the color you provided -- the rest of the -- your expectations there just on the fee side, how we should think about the trajectory of wealth management and possibly on the card side and IB as well, just what you're seeing there in terms of underlying drivers.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, first -- it's a hard -- I mean, there are like 15 underlying drivers, right? And so you should look at each of the specifics and do your own modeling based upon what you think, right? We've got credit card revenues. We've got trading. We've got all these different pieces. It's just not one monolithic number.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And maybe I'll just give you a couple of pieces of color underneath that. So obviously, on the investment management line, market levels matter a lot. As we've pointed out, about two-thirds of that line is equities.\\n\\nThe rest is fixed income. Most of it gets priced in advance based on the prior -- the first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter, prior quarter. So you can -- so that's a pretty good way to sort of think about that line going forward. If you look at card fees, as Charlie talked about, we've got a debit card and credit card business as we sort of see growth across the economy and we're successful in growing our business, that will drive that line.\\n\\nInvestment banking is somewhat market dependent, but we've been investing there quite a bit. And so the goal is to increase market share methodically over time. And so those are kind of the biggest pieces of the puzzle there. But hopefully, that's a little helpful.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nNo, it is helpful, Mike. I appreciate you walking through the details there.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd the final question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, Mike. Hi, Charlie. Can you guys share with us maybe a little color on the commercial real estate office portfolio? It looks like the stabilization may be sitting in on the credit quality. Can -- any indicators of is it getting less worse? Or when you go into market property down the markets maybe aren't as severe as they were six months ago or 12 months ago.\\n\\nI'll take it. It's an interesting question because it depends on -- I think it depends on who you talk to and how you actually answer -- how you actually ask the question. Meaning, when we look at what's actually happening, things aren't getting better, and it is kind of more of the same but it's impacting more properties. Maybe to some extent, there is a little bit of contagion to properties that are fairly well leased, but people are looking for better deals because they think there's weakness out there.\\n\\nSo you see a little bit of that. But what you see is just more of the significant revaluation because of supply and demand that's going on as these properties kind of move through the cycle. So as we look at it, our kind of big picture is based upon what we expected. There aren't material changes at all.\\n\\nWe're actually seeing that play out, but things are getting worse because there are more properties being impacted. So it depends on whether it's versus your expectations or what you've seen in the prior period.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And, Gerard, I would just add one other piece. So it's the same -- we're seeing the same kind of trend where kind of new buildings, renovated buildings in good locations are doing fine. It's older office buildings pretty consistent across the U.S.\\n\\nBut as Charlie said, it's within the expectations we've had, which we have been pretty -- we were pretty down on the space now for a while. And so it's playing out kind of largely within that range of what we thought, but it's going to -- and as I have said over and over, like it's going to take a while to play out. This is not something that will take a quarter or two and be over. It will play out over a longer period of time, and we feel really good about our allowance for coverage ratio.\\n\\nWe feel like that's more than appropriate for kind of what we expect to see here, and we're going to continue to work with clients as best we can through it.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. And then I know -- gosh, it's only been less than a month since the Fed cut the Fed funds rate. And obviously, the forward curve is calling for more. And you guys, as you addressed in your prepared remarks, Mike, about deposit costs.\\n\\nThe behavior, I know, again, it's early, but any comments on -- are you seeing the consumers and the corporate customers behaving as expected in terms of what they're doing with their deposits with lower rates? And as the second part of that question, with your loan-to-deposit ratio not being very high, of course, is there more room for you to lower deposit costs and not have to be as concerned being over levered?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I'd say, look, the short answer on the behavior side is not much has changed since in the last three weeks. The trend, though, that we have seen now for the better part of a year-ish is that we've seen less migration to higher-yielding alternatives. We've seen good stabilization of deposits across the businesses.\\n\\nThose trends are all still true, and we're not seeing that shift in any significant way in any of the businesses at this point. I think as you look at both deposit pricing and the other side of the equation that you sort of brought up, on the loan side, we feel it's really important to have a very consistent approach to underwriting credit over a long period of time. And that's kind of where -- what we've been doing. And I think that's served us well, and I think that's going to continue to be the approach.\\n\\nOn the deposit side, I think we'll do -- we'll make the decisions we think are the right decisions to -- product by product and client by client based on the relationships we have. And I think -- and so far, again, that's worked out well for us. So that's the approach we're going to continue to take.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. I appreciate the color and candor. Thank you.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nOK. We thank everyone for joining us, and we'll talk to you next time.\\n\\nMichael P.

      "    \"title\": \"Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market Analysis, Trends, Technological Advancements, and Forecast from 2024 to 2032 | Taiwan News | Oct. 11, 2024 10:57\",\n",
      "    \"body\": \"Report Ocean has published a new report on the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market, delivering an extensive analysis of key factors such as market restraints, drivers, and opportunities. The report offers a detailed examination of industry trends and developments shaping the growth of the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance market. It also provides a comprehensive analysis and forecast of the market future performance.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market Size Expands at Significant CAGR of 9.25% to Touch Value of USD 2 Billion by 2030\\n\\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc18815\\n\\nSaudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market is flourishing due to the rapid adoption of advanced technologies, growing security concerns, government's mandates for enhancing security, and an increasing number of infrastructure development projects across the Kingdom.\\n\\nReport Ocean, a leading strategic consulting and market research firm, in its recent study, estimated the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market size at USD 1.01 billion in 2023. During the forecast period between 2024 and 2030, Report Ocean expects the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market size to expand at a CAGR of 9.25% reaching a value of 1.98 billion by 2030. Video Surveillance Market in Saudi Arabia is propelled by the growing imperative for a robust security infrastructure to enhance safety and curb crime rates throughout the nation. This heightened demand for video surveillance systems is not only spurred by their integration into the industrial sector and commercial real-estate hubs such as Neom Business City and Sudhir Industrial City but also by increased private sector investments in educational institutions and ongoing construction projects in the transportation sector like the Riyadh Metro.\\n\\nBy volume, Report Ocean estimated the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market size at 186 million units in 2023. During the forecast period between 2024 and 2030, Report Ocean expects the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market size to expand at a CAGR of 10.41% reaching the volume of 279 million units by 2030.\\n\\nGet a Free Sample PDF copy of the report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc18815\\n\\nThe upsurge in video surveillance adoption is additionally fueled by a rising emphasis on safety and security due to an uptick in disposable income and an increase in theft cases. Furthermore, the infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a pivotal role in accelerating the market share of video surveillance in the Kingdom. The Saudi government's substantial investments in national development programs, notably Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program, align with the broader National Vision 2030, emphasizing policy development for infrastructure enhancement in Saudi Arabia. These initiatives, prompted by heightened security concerns and awareness, serve as catalysts, propelling overall demand and contributing significantly to the expansion of the Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market in the coming years.\\n\\nImpact of Escalating Geopolitical Tensions on Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market\\n\\nThe Saudi Arabia Video Surveillance Market experiences profound impacts due to escalating geopolitical tensions. This shift is notably evident in the deepening economic ties between Saudi Arabia and China. With China emerging as a major trading partner and significant investor, the dynamics extend beyond economic realms into strategic partnerships, notably in armed drone production. Saudi Arabia's recent approval to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization aligns with this geopolitical shift, further emphasizing the evolving landscape.

      "    \"body\": \"Welcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\\n\\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\\n\\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Michael Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\\n\\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\\n\\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights.\\n\\nOur results were solid with $5.1 billion of net income, diluted earnings per share of $1.42, and ROE of 11.7%, and an ROTCE of 13.9%. All were up from the second quarter. Our earnings profile is very different than it was five years ago as we've been making strategic investments in many of our businesses and deemphasizing or selling others. Our revenue sources are more diverse, and our fee-based revenue has grown 16% during the first nine months of the year, largely offsetting the net interest income headwinds we have faced over the last year.\\n\\nWe have maintained strong credit discipline and driven significant operating efficiencies in the company while investing heavily to build a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity. Headcount has declined every quarter for four years and was down 20% and since the third quarter of 2020. Our expenses in the third quarter were down from both the second quarter and a year ago. Average loans declined from the second quarter as we have maintained strong credit standards and our focus on returns over volume.\\n\\nWe've continued to grow our credit card portfolio with balances growing for 13 consecutive quarters, and commercial loan demand remains weak, reflecting economic uncertainty and the expectation that rates will be lower in the future. Overall deposits declined slightly from the second quarter, but deposit balances in our customer-facing businesses continue to grow, which has enabled us to reduce higher-cost treasury, corporate treasury deposits. We have started to reduce deposit pricing in response to the recent Fed rate cuts, and we're closely monitoring market conditions and will continue to make adjustments. Both our consumer and commercial customers have remained resilient.\\n\\nIn our wholesale businesses, credit performance improved from the second quarter with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. The office market remains weak, and we continue to expect additional charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio and have accordingly maintained strong allowance coverage. Overall, customers in our consumer businesses continued to hold up relatively well, benefiting from a strong labor market and wage growth. Consumer charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven by lower losses in our credit card portfolio, while our other consumer portfolios continue to perform well, reflecting the benefit of prior credit-tightening actions.\\n\\nWe continue to look for changes in consumer health, but we have not seen meaningful changes in trends when looking at delinquency statistics across our consumer credit portfolios. Both credit card and debit card spend were up in the third quarter from a year ago. And although the pace of growth has slowed, it is still healthy. We continue to see more pronounced stress in certain customer segments with lower deposit and asset levels where inflation has partially offset strong employment and wage growth.\\n\\nThe benefits of inflation slowing and interest rates starting to ease should be helpful to all customers but especially those on the lower end of the income scale. Our capital position remains strong with our CET1 ratio of 11.3%, up from 11% last quarter, and we continue to return significant amounts of excess capital to shareholders. We repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock in the quarter and $15.6 billion of common stock during the first three quarters of this year, up over 60% from a year ago, and we increased our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14%. Shareholders have meaningfully benefited from our capital management actions as our earnings per share are up over 50% since the third quarter of 2019, benefiting from the 22% decline in diluted average common shares over the same period.\\n\\nNow let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work, which remains our top priority. We continue to move forward with confidence and believe we have the right culture, team, discipline, and sense of urgency to complete the work that's required. That includes what is required under the recent formal agreement we entered with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We are also continuing to execute on our other strategic priorities.\\n\\nWe continue to build our credit card business. And this past quarter, we launched two new co-branded credit cards with Expedia which provide our customers a unique travel rewards program with instant discounts, enhanced perks, and accelerated rewards. Our broader set of credit card products continue to be well received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells Fargo with nearly 2 million new credit card accounts this year. Last month, we announced a multiyear co-branded agreement with Volkswagen Financial Services.\\n\\nStarting in the first half of next year, we will be the preferred purchase financing provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands in the United States. The investments we've been making in our consumer, small, and business banking segment are starting to generate growth. After several years of no growth, net check accounts have now grown for three consecutive quarters, and we believe our debit card share has started to increase as well. Mobile active users increased by 1.6 million or 5% from last year.\\n\\nWe are also investing in our branches and have refurbished over 460 branches during the first three quarters of this year. We continue to hire proven leaders in our corporate investment bank. In investment banking, we made several important hires focused on key coverage and product groups to help us build on our momentum and grow the business. We also hired a new vice chair of corporate banking, who is focused on helping us continue to expand and grow that franchise.\\n\\nWe also continue to attract experienced leaders in other areas. And in the third quarter, Bridget Engle joined Wells Fargo as head of technology reporting to me. I've worked with Bridget in the past and know firsthand how her deep experience, leading large-scale technology transformations of large global financial institutions will benefit Wells Fargo. Our strategic priorities also include focusing on businesses that are core to our consumer and corporate clients and when they aren't, shrinking, or selling them.\\n\\nAs part of this effort, during the third quarter, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third-party servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business. We will continue servicing agency loans and loans held on our balance sheet. Looking ahead, overall, the U.S. economy remains strong with inflation slowing and a resilient labor market, boosting income and supporting consumer spending.\\n\\nCompany balance sheets are strong, contributing to both consumption and investment in the economy but slowing demand for commercial lending. We continue to be prepared for a variety of economic environments, and we'll balance our desire to increase returns and grow while protecting the downside. We have one of the most enviable franchises in the industry and a top management team capable of delivering strong results. I want to thank everyone who I worked with at Wells Fargo for everything they've done to transform this great company.\\n\\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the results in the third quarter. We again saw good growth in noninterest income across most businesses and expenses were well controlled. Net income for the third quarter was $5.1 billion or $1.42 per diluted common share.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, we took the opportunity to reposition a portion of the investment securities portfolio. Our results included $447 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities. This included the sale of approximately $16 billion of securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into securities with yields approximately 130 basis points higher than the securities we sold. The estimated earn-back period for this repositioning is a little over two years.\\n\\nWithout the impact of the investment securities portfolio repositioning, earnings per share would have been $1.52. When looking at our results compared with a year ago, I'd remind you that our third quarter results last year included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits. Turning to Slide 4. Net interest income declined $233 million or 2% from the second quarter.\\n\\n$128 million of this decline was due to the increased pricing on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts and wealth and investment management that we highlighted on last quarter's call. This was the lowest linked-quarter decline in net interest income since third quarter 2023 as customer migration to higher-yielding deposit products continued to slow and the pace of deposit pricing increases also decelerated. Deposit costs were up 7 basis points in the third quarter with approximately half of this increase driven by the pricing increase on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. The third quarter increase in deposit costs was lower than the 10-basis-point increase in the second quarter and the 16-basis-point rise in the first quarter.\\n\\nIn response to the Federal Reserve rate cut in September, we have reduced rates on promotional deposit offers in our consumer businesses, pricing on sweep deposits, and advisory brokerage accounts which are aligned to money market funds will continue to move in line with Fed rate cuts. Commercial deposit pricing has responded quickly to Federal Reserve rate reductions, just as it did when rates were rising. We are continuously monitoring competitive conditions and deposit trends, and we'll adjust pricing, tenor, and de-balance requirements based on our observations. We highlight loans and deposits on Slide 5.\\n\\nAverage loans were down from both the second quarter and a year ago with continued growth in credit card loan balances more than offset by declines in most other categories. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits increased $1.4 billion from a year ago and growth in our customer deposits enabled us to reduce higher-cost corporate treasury deposits. Average deposits were down $4.8 billion in the second quarter.\\n\\nThis decline was driven by an $18.5 billion reduction in higher-cost corporate treasury deposits, while customer deposits grew $13.7 billion from the second quarter. All else equal, a reduction in corporate treasury deposits is a positive for net interest income in the current environment. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 6. We had strong growth in noninterest income, up 12% from a year ago.\\n\\nAs Charlie highlighted, this growth reflects the benefits of the investments we've been making in our businesses, as well as market conditions. We grew noninterest income across most categories, including double-digit increases year over year in many of our largest fee-generating activities, including investment advisory, net gains from trading activities, deposit-related fees, and investment banking. We also benefited from improved results in our venture capital investments. I will highlight the specific drivers of noninterest income growth when discussing our operating segment results.\\n\\nTurning to expenses on Slide 7. Noninterest expense declined from both the second quarter and a year ago. The impact of our efficiency initiatives helps reduce salaries and professional and outside services expense compared with a year ago. These declines were partially offset by higher revenue-related compensation predominantly in wealth and investment management, as well as higher technology and equipment expense.\\n\\nOperating losses declined from a year ago and from the higher levels we had in the first half of this year. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs decreased 8 basis points from the second quarter to 49 basis points of average loans. The decline was driven by lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $145 million from the second quarter to 24 basis points of average loans with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios.\\n\\nWhile losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio declined in the third quarter, market fundamentals remained weak, and we still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients. Consumer net loan charge-offs declined $45 million from the second quarter to 83 basis points of average loans, driven by lower losses in the credit card portfolio. Nonperforming assets decreased 3% in the second quarter, driven by lower commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Commercial real estate office nonaccruals declined $164 million, which included paydowns and net loan charge-offs.\\n\\nMoving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $50 million from the second quarter with modest declines across most asset classes, largely offset by an increase in allowance for credit card loans, driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for loans has been relatively stable over the past year as credit trends remain within our expectations. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% since third quarter of 2023.\\n\\nTurning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.3% continued to be well above our new CET1 regulatory minimum, plus buffers of 9.8%, which became effective in the fourth quarter. The increase in our CET1 ratio from the second quarter included a benefit of 28 basis points from higher accumulated other comprehensive income due to lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads. With the $3.5 billion of common stock repurchased in the third quarter, our share repurchases during the first three quarters of this year were $6 billion higher than the same period a year ago, and diluted average shares outstanding declined 7% from a year ago.\\n\\nTurning to our operating segment results, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 11. Consumer small and business banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. However, the pace of migration continued to slow. The slight increase in home lending revenue from a year ago was driven by higher mortgage banking fees.\\n\\nCredit card revenue declined 2% from a year ago as lower fee revenue more than offset higher net interest income. Auto revenue decreased 24% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was also driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12.\\n\\nRetail mortgage originations declined 14% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we've made on simplifying the home lending business but grew 4% from the second quarter. We also continue to make progress on reducing the size of our servicing business. The amount of third-party mortgage loan service was down 16% from a year ago. Since we announced our new strategy early last year, we reduced headcount at home lending by 46%.\\n\\nThe size of our auto portfolio continued to decline with period-end loan balances down 14% from a year ago, driven by previous credit tightening actions. Origination volume in the third quarter was stable year over year and grew 11% from the second quarter. Debit card spending increased $2.3 billion or 2% from a year ago, and credit card spending was up 10% from a year ago with growth in all categories, except fuel. Payment rates were modestly lower than a year ago but remained above pre-pandemic levels.\\n\\nTurning to commercial banking results on Slide 13. Middle-market banking revenue was down 1% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income and lease income, partially offset by improved results from our -- from equity investments. Average loan balances in the third quarter were down 1% compared with a year ago.\\n\\nLoan demand remained weak as many clients remain cautious about investing in inventory buildup and capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty and high borrowing costs. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue was down 5% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. Commercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances, partially offset by higher capital markets revenue.\\n\\nMarkets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in rates, structured products, and municipals, partially offset by lower revenue and equities. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by continued reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio and lower loan balances and banking as clients continue to access capital markets funding. On Slide 15, wealth and investment management revenue increased 5% compared with a year ago due to higher asset-based fees, driven by increased market valuations, as well as higher brokerage transaction activity, partially offset by lower net interest income, driven by the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts. As a reminder, the majority of advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were up from both a year ago and from July 1.\\n\\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined a year ago, driven by net losses on debt securities related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by improved results from our venture capital investments. Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on Slide 17. We currently expect fourth quarter 2024 net interest income to be roughly in line with the third quarter of 2024, which would imply an approximately 9% decline in full-year 2024 net interest income compared with 2023.\\n\\nBased on this expectation, we believe we are close to the trough. However, exactly when the securities will be influenced by a variety of factors, including the pace of Fed rate changes, deposit mix and pricing, and day count. Turning to expenses. We still expect full-year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately $54 billion, which has not changed from our guidance last quarter.\\n\\nAs a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. In summary, we had solid results in the third quarter, which demonstrated the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our returns. We grew noninterest income by 12% from a year ago with growth across most businesses. We achieved this double-digit growth even with the $447 million loss we took to reposition the investment securities portfolio which will start to benefit our results in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nWhile this growth in noninterest income was more than offset by an expected decline in net interest income, the investments we have made in our businesses drive better fee income, and diversify our revenue were evident. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with expenses down from a year ago and headcount down for 17 consecutive quarters. Our results also reflected our credit discipline and strong capital position which has enabled us to return more than $23 billion to shareholders over the past year through common stock, dividends, and share repurchases. And while we are pleased with the progress we've made, we are even more excited about the additional opportunity we have throughout all the businesses to continue to improve our results.\\n\\n[Operator instructions] The first question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Sir, please go ahead.\\n\\nScott Siefers -- Analyst\\n\\nMorning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to start with NII. So your fourth quarter number should be flattish with the third quarter level, and I believe you mentioned toward the end of your prepared remarks that you believe Wells is sort of close to the trough.\\n\\nI was hoping you could just unpack, please, a bit more what you see as the swing -- the main swing factors either way, as well as kind of what it might take from here for it to begin to inflect back up -- pardon me, back upward more visibly.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Scott. No, I appreciate the question. So I mean, it's the same drivers we've been talking about now for the last number of quarters. So obviously, deposits and the mix of those deposits is going to be a big factor in the near term.\\n\\nI think as you can see in our trend that NIB deposits were behaving pretty well. I will note, though, in the trend that there is a product switch conversion that we did that sort of impacted NIVs and IV. So if you take that out, the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits is effectively flat to the third quarter, and so that's the first time now in a while where we've seen that be the case. And so that's one of the factors that we'll have to see sort of play out for a little bit longer time period.\\n\\nBut so far, so good in terms of that trend participating in the way we thought or behaving the way we thought. Obviously, deposit pricing as rates come back down or is going to be a big factor. If you look at, as I said in my remarks, on the consumer side, we've already adjusted promo rates, as well as CDs. Those will continue to adjust as rates move.\\n\\nWe're seeing exactly what we thought we would see on the most interest rate-sensitive deposits on the commercial side as rates started to come down. The betas are exactly what we thought and are pretty high for those deposits. So that's working. Obviously, we haven't seen any loan growth, but we weren't expecting that, but that will be a factor as you sort of look a little bit -- over a little bit longer time period.\\n\\nAnd then this is a little bit in the weeds. But as you sort of look at the first quarter, you do have day counts and things to kind of adjust for. So you could bounce around a little bit depending on the quarter based on factors like that as well.\\n\\nScott Siefers -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Perfect. And then you touched -- I appreciate that. And then you touched on loan demand is a factor as well.\\n\\nYou all have been pretty reserved regarding that backdrop throughout the year, which has been borne out to be correct. I guess, hopefully, we're beginning to get some clarity on some of the unresolved issues like cost to borrow and I guess we're getting closer to the election. Maybe just some additional thoughts on the overall outlook there, if possible, please.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, I think -- I mean, you hit on a couple of the things that people are thinking about. But based on the conversations our teams are having with clients, I think people are still being very prudent about borrowing. I think the 50-basis-point reduction is helpful, but not by itself a factor that will drive people to borrow or not, I think they'll need to see that come down more meaningfully if that's like the driving force.\\n\\nThe uncertainty around the election, the uncertainty around the just macro backdrop, I think as people get more confidence that the baseline case of a soft landing will materialize, you get past the election, you see rates come down a little bit. I think all those things will come together and help give clients more confidence about either building inventories or making further capital expenditures that they're just -- they're holding off on now. So I think you got to see a few of those things come together. And as you say, as we get closer to the end of the year, you'll start to get a little bit more visibility there, and we'll see as it goes.\\n\\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\\n\\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, good morning. I guess first question, I think Charlie addressed this a little bit in his opening remarks around expenses, and I appreciate you're not talking about 2025 today. But big picture, looking at your Slide 7, personnel expenses, flat 8.6% year over year; noncomp, flat 4.2% year over year. From a shareholder perspective and given what you've said, is it fair to assume we continue to see some of this flat-lining trend where there are enough savings to reinvest in the platform, grow fee revenues, and do all the stuff that you're doing but without seeing a meaningful change in these two categories as we look forward?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThis is Charlie. I guess I'll just repeat what we've said in the past, which is we think that there continue to be meaningful efficiencies around the company, but we also are investing in both spending whatever we need to spend in the risk and regulatory space, as well as investing for the future. And when we get to next quarter, we'll talk about 2025. And we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves because that's something that we think we've done a good job of balancing historically, and we'll continue to balance it, going forward, in our thinking.\\n\\nAnd when we've got specifics to share, we'll share it.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd, Ebrahim, I'll just maybe point out one other thing. As you look at things like personnel expense, obviously, there's lots that go underneath that. So we are seeing the efficiency come through on salaries and other items, and that's offset by revenue-related expense, mostly in the wealth and investment management business. And so that's a good thing, right? So you may see that bounce around, but underneath that is the efficiency really coming through as headcount continues to come down, I think we both probably pointed it out that headcount came down again in the quarter.\\n\\nSo we're continuing to execute on that part of the efficiency agenda, as well as all the other non-personnel expenses. But again, I just -- I don't think our thinking has changed about efficiency opportunities but also opportunities to invest. We just need to go through our own internal process as we think about 2025. And when we finish that, we'll share it.\\n\\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\\n\\nThat's helpful. And just maybe one quick -- Mike, I'm sorry if I missed it on NII. It's an asset-sensitive balance sheet. We go to September, 50 basis points cut.\\n\\nI would have assumed fourth quarter NII would have declined, and maybe there's about $50 million of bond book restructuring help. Just why then NII not going down despite the 50 basis points? And is there more room for additional restructuring as we look forward? Thank you.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I mean, look, it's just a confluence of all the factors that come together right around sort of what's happening with the mix of deposits. Our mix is a little bit different obviously than others. I think the pricing actions we took across the deposit base help as you look into the fourth quarter as well.\\n\\nAnd then obviously, we've got assets continue to kind of reprice up. We've got the repositioning but also just normal reinvestment as we've seen maturities roll. I think on repositioning, we've been sort of repositioning the portfolio for a while, and we'll continue to look at it. Nothing on the horizon right now, but we'll continue to look at it as we always do, and we'll let you know if we decide to do more.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd the only thing I'd add is when you think about just rate movement, you need to look at the different points along the curve.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Good morning. My first question is could you remind us, based on your understanding, what happens next after you submit your third-party review to the Fed as it relates to the asset cap work stream?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, so just the way consent orders work, I'll answer it very generally because we don't talk about anything specific relative to where we are and what the timing is. We haven't and we won't, is you get a consent order. We need to do the work to develop a very detailed plan. The regulators then look at that plan and give us feedback on the plan.\\n\\nWe execute on that plan. And whatever is required in that submission when we're done with the work, we submit it to them. And then they have done some work along the way, but they generally do a review after the submission. And then they've got a series of formal processes that they need to go through to make the decision on whether the work has been done to their satisfaction.\\n\\nAnd when that's done, we find out about it, and you find out about it.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. OK. And just as a follow-up. You bought back $3.5 billion of shares in the third quarter.\\n\\nMike, is this about the -- this pace that we should expect until we get your next SCB in June? I'm just trying to think about framing the buyback opportunity over the next few quarters.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Erika. We don't really talk about quarter-to-quarter pace. But I think if you look at where we stand from a capital perspective, we're 150 basis points over the new reg minimum, plus buffers of 9.8%. So we go into this environment with plenty of excess capital.\\n\\nWe're going to generate more capital, obviously, through earnings as we go. And then we go through the normal process that we go through every quarter to look at sort of the opportunities we have to help support clients. We look at the risks that are out there, and then we'll decide on the exact pacing sort of as we go. But we're happy that we were able to buy back $15.5 billion so far year to date.\\n\\nAnd continuing to give excess capital back to shareholders is something that's top of mind for us.\\n\\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Good morning. So first question, just want to understand if the asset cap were to be removed -- well, I should say when the asset cap is removed, right? What -- are there opportunities for you to lean in anywhere in terms of asset growth? Because I've heard you in the past several times, and I would assume it's the same today that the asset cap is not keeping you from doing anything that you want to do. And maybe that's wrong, but I just want to understand where you would lean in if it -- when it does get removed.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Mike, I'll start, and then you can either amplify or change if you disagree with anything I say. I think what we see and what we have talked a little bit about is the places where we have been the most careful about the assets and our liabilities today is around. On the wholesale deposit side, there's certainly been places where we've had to be very careful about not bringing on significant deposits because we want to make sure that we've got the room to serve customers elsewhere, both relative to their borrowing needs, as well as consumer deposits.\\n\\nAnd obviously, when commercial deposits come in, it brings cash with it. The other place has been in our markets business where we actually -- since the asset cap has been in existence, we've not just limited but reduced somewhat the financing abilities that we have for our customers. So those are the two places where we'd probably see the impact immediately, not incredibly significant changes by any stretch of the imagination, but we've been -- had to be very, very careful in those two places. And then beyond that, it's just normal growth opportunities that we would see across all the different parts of the company.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the expense side, you've talked in the past about the $2.2 billion that has been invested to address the issues in the consent order and to deal with them. When the consent order goes away, is there an opportunity to pull back on that at all?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe're not even -- honestly, we literally aren't even thinking about that. We still have more work to do. We've said that that is the most important thing. At some point, can we become more efficient in some of the things? Absolutely.\\n\\nBut what's most important is from our standpoint to make sure that the things we've built become part of the culture of the company. So it's just not -- it's just -- when we think about efficiencies, we think about there are plenty of other places for us to drive efficiencies and not focus on those activities at this point.\\n\\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning. I was hoping you guys could talk about the anti-money laundering KYC, the disclosure in the 10-Q value investigation. And then there was some regulatory outcome on that and given that it was in your 10-Q and so public. Wondering if you could just add some color around it? And then also just what it might mean to expenses and anything else we should be mindful of going forward? Thank you.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I mean, we put out something when we entered into the formal agreement with the OCC. And like other things that we find and they find, we take them extremely seriously. We're going to get the work done.\\n\\nAs I've said in my prepared remarks, I think as we identify issues and we see that there are things that have to get built, we've got confidence that we've got the ability to do it. I would say, relative to the cost around it, I'd say the two different pieces, which is just like all of the control-related work, we're going to spend whatever is necessary. At this point, as we sit and look at the $54 billion expense base, don't see it having anything meaningfully that we need to talk about beyond our ability to spend as we've discussed. And I would also mention that, and I think we've said something about this, which is a significant amount of the work that is required in the consent order, we've been working on.\\n\\nAnd so as we think about what we're spending, we're spending a significant amount of money relative to what's necessary in that order already.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. And then are you able to comment is this kind of a Wells-specific thing or an industrywide kind of area focus because you know the banks are responsible not just for kind of policing their customers but really keeping track of all the money that is moving around. It seems like it could be a broader focus on that.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe're not going to speak -- we speak for ourselves and what we know. Beyond that is not right or appropriate.\\n\\nThe next question will come from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.\\n\\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up with the regulatory side. And can you remind us of the mechanics of the asset cap without providing any insight as to when you think it may come off? But can the asset cap be removed in your opinion without the consent order being removed completely?\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nListen, I would -- for anyone who's -- if you have questions on the 2018 Fed consent order, it's very readable. It's something like -- I don't remember exactly, but it's like five pages -- seven pages, Mike is telling me of which there are like -- there's a page in there, which is really the page that lays out what we have to accomplish and how the Fed is going to look at things. So it really is very digestible. So I'll give you a brief summary.\\n\\nBut again, please, I'd point you back to it if you want to go through it. We're required to -- the board needs to be more effective. We need to build out operational risk and compliance in the company. There is -- to lift the asset cap, that work needs to be adopted and implemented and to lift the entire consent order needs to be effective and sustainable.\\n\\nAnd so that's what's laid out the way the Fed will interpret those things, and relative to things going on in the company is certainly in their bailiwick. As I've said, we're very focused on getting the work done and feel good about our ability to get it done, given what we've shown that we can do here.\\n\\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. Thank you, Charlie. Appreciate it. And then the other question I had was related to the trading gains line, and you've been putting up over $1 billion there per quarter in trading gains.\\n\\nWhat are some of the puts and takes in that line that can create some volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I'll -- it's Michael. I'll take that. Obviously, volatility in the market, a big factor.\\n\\nSo it's kind of the market conditions that we operate in. You generally have some seasonality to that line item, as well in the third and fourth quarter as you get to the holiday season. And then I think where we've been focused there is really just continuing to methodically improve the capabilities, make sure we got the right people in the right seats. We continue to improve our -- all of our technology and e-trading capabilities.\\n\\nAnd we're seeing good results of that, but it's something that can move around based on market conditions quite a bit, but our focus is just to make sure that we continue to have the right capabilities to serve clients. And we've been pleased now that we've strung together probably seven quarters of pretty good performance there, and we'll look forward to happens going forward.\\n\\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning. Just around the -- a little bit more around the securities repositioning, how much of a benefit to net interest income did the securities repositioning have this quarter? And how much of a -- would it be a full-quarter impact that you would expect for the fourth quarter?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nVery little in the third quarter. It's all done. So it's in the run rate for the fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. And then have you sized up that impact? And what it would mean for NII for the fourth quarter?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt's in the -- in my remarks where we did about $16 billion of repositioning. We picked up about 130 basis points on that. So I mean, obviously, you got to go day count and other things to adjust, but it's pretty easy to model.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nRight. OK. All right. And then separately, just around the fee income commentary, I appreciate the color you provided -- the rest of the -- your expectations there just on the fee side, how we should think about the trajectory of wealth management and possibly on the card side and IB as well, just what you're seeing there in terms of underlying drivers.\\n\\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, first -- it's a hard -- I mean, there are like 15 underlying drivers, right? And so you should look at each of the specifics and do your own modeling based upon what you think, right? We've got credit card revenues. We've got trading. We've got all these different pieces. It's just not one monolithic number.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And maybe I'll just give you a couple of pieces of color underneath that. So obviously, on the investment management line, market levels matter a lot. As we've pointed out, about two-thirds of that line is equities.\\n\\nThe rest is fixed income. Most of it gets priced in advance based on the prior -- the first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter, prior quarter. So you can -- so that's a pretty good way to sort of think about that line going forward. If you look at card fees, as Charlie talked about, we've got a debit card and credit card business as we sort of see growth across the economy and we're successful in growing our business, that will drive that line.\\n\\nInvestment banking is somewhat market dependent, but we've been investing there quite a bit. And so the goal is to increase market share methodically over time. And so those are kind of the biggest pieces of the puzzle there. But hopefully, that's a little helpful.\\n\\nJohn Pancari -- Analyst\\n\\nNo, it is helpful, Mike. I appreciate you walking through the details there.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd the final question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, Mike. Hi, Charlie. Can you guys share with us maybe a little color on the commercial real estate office portfolio? It looks like the stabilization may be sitting in on the credit quality. Can -- any indicators of is it getting less worse? Or when you go into market property down the markets maybe aren't as severe as they were six months ago or 12 months ago.\\n\\nI'll take it. It's an interesting question because it depends on -- I think it depends on who you talk to and how you actually answer -- how you actually ask the question. Meaning, when we look at what's actually happening, things aren't getting better, and it is kind of more of the same but it's impacting more properties. Maybe to some extent, there is a little bit of contagion to properties that are fairly well leased, but people are looking for better deals because they think there's weakness out there.\\n\\nSo you see a little bit of that. But what you see is just more of the significant revaluation because of supply and demand that's going on as these properties kind of move through the cycle. So as we look at it, our kind of big picture is based upon what we expected. There aren't material changes at all.\\n\\nWe're actually seeing that play out, but things are getting worse because there are more properties being impacted. So it depends on whether it's versus your expectations or what you've seen in the prior period.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And, Gerard, I would just add one other piece. So it's the same -- we're seeing the same kind of trend where kind of new buildings, renovated buildings in good locations are doing fine. It's older office buildings pretty consistent across the U.S.\\n\\nBut as Charlie said, it's within the expectations we've had, which we have been pretty -- we were pretty down on the space now for a while. And so it's playing out kind of largely within that range of what we thought, but it's going to -- and as I have said over and over, like it's going to take a while to play out. This is not something that will take a quarter or two and be over. It will play out over a longer period of time, and we feel really good about our allowance for coverage ratio.\\n\\nWe feel like that's more than appropriate for kind of what we expect to see here, and we're going to continue to work with clients as best we can through it.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. And then I know -- gosh, it's only been less than a month since the Fed cut the Fed funds rate. And obviously, the forward curve is calling for more. And you guys, as you addressed in your prepared remarks, Mike, about deposit costs.\\n\\nThe behavior, I know, again, it's early, but any comments on -- are you seeing the consumers and the corporate customers behaving as expected in terms of what they're doing with their deposits with lower rates? And as the second part of that question, with your loan-to-deposit ratio not being very high, of course, is there more room for you to lower deposit costs and not have to be as concerned being over levered?\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I'd say, look, the short answer on the behavior side is not much has changed since in the last three weeks. The trend, though, that we have seen now for the better part of a year-ish is that we've seen less migration to higher-yielding alternatives. We've seen good stabilization of deposits across the businesses.\\n\\nThose trends are all still true, and we're not seeing that shift in any significant way in any of the businesses at this point. I think as you look at both deposit pricing and the other side of the equation that you sort of brought up, on the loan side, we feel it's really important to have a very consistent approach to underwriting credit over a long period of time. And that's kind of where -- what we've been doing. And I think that's served us well, and I think that's going to continue to be the approach.\\n\\nOn the deposit side, I think we'll do -- we'll make the decisions we think are the right decisions to -- product by product and client by client based on the relationships we have. And I think -- and so far, again, that's worked out well for us. So that's the approach we're going to continue to take.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. I appreciate the color and candor. Thank you.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nOK. We thank everyone for joining us, and we'll talk to you next time.\\n\\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nScott Siefers -- Analyst\",\n",

By utilizing a single motor for both systems, OEMs can optimize production costs and potentially make anti-pinch power windows a standard feature. The power window system activates upon vehicle ignition or retained power operation. Encoders monitor motor operation, sending pulse signals to power window switches. The body control module manages power supply and retention. Door switches transmit door status information, while power window switches engage their respective anti-pinch systems. Door lock assemblies transmit key cylinder switch operating conditions to the anti-pinch main switch. Given the motor similarity between anti-pinch power window systems and soft-close door systems, sharing motors between the two systems represents a significant cost-saving measure.

The company's diverse portfolio, spanning cannabis, beverages, and wellness products, has contributed to its robust performance.\\n\\nThe beverage alcohol segment showed exceptional growth, with revenue increasing by 132% to $56 million.

In the last five years, Tilray Brands has evolved into a new company. We no longer are just a Canadian cannabis LP. Tilray Brands has grown tremendously, and we're setting a new precedent for the CPG industry. Not only have we set the stage for a new era of consumer habits, Tilray Brands has pushed forward, disrupting the global CPG industry and revolutionizing consumer products. Tilray is at the forefront of innovation, pioneering and leading the convergence of beverages, cannabis, hemp, wellness, and distribution industries on a global scale. Our operations span over 20 countries and five continents with 44 consumer-connected lifestyle brands and 20 vertically integrated facilities that produce approximately 90% of our products in-house, ensuring the highest quality of our products. Tilray continues to lead with the number one cannabis business in Canada, leading medical cannabis business across Europe, the number one branded hemp business in North America, and the fifth-largest craft beer business in the U.S. Our success in building a new era of consumer products that resonates with today's discerning consumers and caters to their ever-evolving consumption habits and transforming the way consumers eat, drink and unwind with cannabis, hemp, and beverage products is a testament to our commitment on delivering innovative products that meets the needs of the modern consumer and drive growth across industries. Moving on to Q1, we achieved our record first-quarter net revenue results, while strengthening our operations, increasing gross margin, and increasing our gross profit. We hit net revenue of $200 million, representing a 13% growth year-over-year. Our gross profit increased by 35% and gross margin increased by over 500 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Our beverage business, including craft beer, spirits, and our new non-alc beers and other non-alcoholic drinks grew 132% in net revenue year-over-year. We strengthened our leadership position as the fifth-largest U.S. craft beer brewer with a 5% market share as a result of our craft acquisition from ABI. We recently launched a new beverage division called Tilray Alternative Beverages, focused on fueling key markets across the U.S., with innovative federally legal, hemp derivative Delta 9, THC branded, and branded products. This is an exciting new segment for us, and our network of distributors, which I'll get into in more detail shortly. We focused our cannabis business on strengthening our operations and increasing our margins, leading to a gross profit increasing by 22%. We continue to lead the branded hemp food industry with a 52% branded market share, with Manitoba Harvest in the U.S. and the Canadian market share of nearly 80%. And our financial foundation remains strong with a robust balance sheet, ample cash reserves, reduced debt levels and flexibility to explore potential new acquisitions. Our financial strength enables us to pursue new opportunities and capitalize on emerging trends in the market. Let's now dive deeper into each of our business segments. Starting with Tilray Beverages. Today, our Beverage division leads with 19 iconic brands, ten network manufacturing facilities and over 700 distributors, 20 brewpubs and restaurants, and leading sales and marketing teams across the U.S. Our beverage strategy is focused on growing our portfolio brands in selected states, regional markets and ensuring product excellence and innovation, driving focused scale, expanding targeted distribution to increase our market penetration and consumer access. In our Beverage segment we generated $56 million of net revenue in Q1. Across our growing craft brands, SweetWater is the number one volume brand family in Georgia, multi-outlet and convenience stores. Montauk is the number one branded family in New York Metro, having increased at a rate of sale of 240 basis points year-over-year. And Tilray is the number one craft supplier in the Pacific Northwest, thanks in part to the continued success of 10 Barrel's Pub Beer, Shock Top remains a leading priority as we relaunch the brand's number one seasonal offering, Shock Top Pretzel. During Q1 and Q2, driving additional 5,000 distribution points in the last 45 days. The Pacific Northwest grew overall Shock Top distribution by 42% during the Q1, adding 1,100 new placements for the brand. In the Northeast, Montauk's flagship Wave Chaser IPA continues to post positive year-over-year volume distribution gains adding a net of 139 off-premise accounts during Q1. Three of SweetWater's top 12-pack SKUs, 420 Pale Ale, OG IPA and the Hazy IPA all posted positive trends for Q1 trending a plus 7%, a plus 24% and a plus 17%, respectively. As we've mentioned before, our ambition is far beyond our current reach, as we continue our focus to become a dominant leading beverage business by leveraging and are strengthening our portfolio of beloved local craft brands, recruiting new customers, and activating more occasions, driving new growth across these brands. Additionally, we are innovating across adjacent categories, including flavored malt beverages, ready-to-drink cocktails, spirits, and also beyond alcohol, we will grow our non-alc beer category and expand further into water, energy and other categories. Our powerful college sports partnerships across the country will be leveraged to bring new LDA consumers and fans into different brand families, especially Shock Top. Separately, our MLS music events and local community partnerships allow our brands to recruit and retain our core customers across different age groups. We have the manufacturing facilities, the distribution, the sales and marketing infrastructure to drive tremendous growth in the Tilray Beverages business. In the non-alcoholic segment, Montauk non-alc craft beer is now sold in 650 counts and new brand, Runner's High Brewing Company has launched in the Southeast with three brews; Runner's High Golden Wheat, Raspberry Wheat, and Dark Chocolate, with several expansion markets to follow. With over 700 beer distributors, Tilray is now a leading supplier in key regions across the U.S., with regional jewels in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, and the Southeast. With each beverage acquisition we've made over the past few years, SweetWater, Green Flash, Alpine, Montauk Brewing, the craft acquisitions from ABI and most recently, the acquisitions of our four brands in Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). We are laser-focused on operational efficiency, optimizing cost structure, and getting the margins of the acquired brands up above 40%, like SweetWater and our other legacy businesses, we've identified additional growth opportunities in our beverage business. Tilray Beverage is going after category diversification and we've identified four categories. We expect to generate $30 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025. These four categories include: light lagers, $117 million category; flavored malt beverages, a $4.7 billion category; sparkling water, a $12 billion category; and the non-alc brew, a $445 million category. With our recent launch of Tilray Alternative Beverages, we are focused on fueling the U.S. with Hemp-Derived Delta-9 beverages, which is an estimated $2.8 billion market in the U.S. We're beginning to launch our Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC brands and products in key states including Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee with distribution driven by our existing and robust beer distribution network. Our initial portfolio of HDD9 brands include Happy Flower, Herb & Bloom, [420 Hops], Fizzy Jane and we expect to launch additional brands by the end of this calendar year. Happy Flower is currently available online through Drink Happy Flower. The growth of Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC drink business in the U.S. is remarkable. And we are excited to see its potential for our beer distribution network who are eager to jump into the business and already have begun placing orders. We look forward to sharing more updates on this development soon. Turning to Tilray Cannabis. In Canada, Tilray continues to lead the Canadian market share by almost 170 bps over the next competitor and have been consistently at the top of the industry for the past three years. From a regional perspective, Tilray is number one across British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. These provinces combined include over 86% of the Canadian population. We've also led in all other markets combined. In adult-use recreational cannabis, we focus on margin improvement across our portfolio brands and products resulting in improved adjusted gross margin by 500 basis points in Q1 versus last year. The margin improvement, partnered with efficient utilization, production, and further cost savings initiatives will allow us to grow our revenue, profitability, sustainability well into the future. In Q1 20% of our net sales revenue came from new innovation. Our mainstream Flower business continued to grow, because of our strong genetics. Our Redecan brand moved up to the number six position brand in Canada as reported by Hifyre data. In Beverages, Tilray continues to dominate the beverage category with a 45% market share, and at the end of August, with XMG, Mollo, THC beverage brands being the number one and number two brands, respectively. Tilray shipped 78 metric tons of biomass, or approximately 25% of the implied Canadian market volume in Q1. We continue to leverage the wholesale channel where contribution margins are better and supply is starting to balance. On an adult-rec we shipped 16 million pre-rolled cones and over 2.1 million cans of beverages in Q1. Turning to our International business in Q1, we continue to execute against our three basic initiatives. First, the acceleration of growth in Germany. In Germany, since the Cannabis Act went into effect on April 1, 2024, we've seen a 50% increase in medical flower sales, as well as a 22% increase in medical cannabis extracts, where we already have a dominant share of the market, and we believe that our current positioning in Germany provides us with several unique competitive advantages to capture a significant share of the expected medical cannabis market, which is projected to be approximately $3 billion in the medium term. We expect to continue our growth in this very important market through commercial excellence and increased supply. We will continue to leverage the expertise and relationship of our CC Pharma / Tilray Pharma distribution business in Germany, which supports our medical cannabis business through its network of 13,000 pharmacy and wholesalers. Second, the bifurcation and differentiation of physician-led and patient-led channels. As a market leader in the physician-led channel, we're turning our focus to accelerating our growth in the patient-led channel. One of our major initiatives in this regard is improving the availability and the quality of our medical cannabis supply to meet needs of patients-led channels by creating a flexible and diversified supply chain focused on high-quality flower and new innovation. At Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Rx, our German cultivation and processing facility, we received the very first commercial cannabis cultivation license and commercial distribution license issued in Germany under the new regulations. These new license granted Tilray the ability to cultivate, produce, and distribute premium quality medical cannabis, with the ability to increase our production by approximately 5 times. Aphria RX can now fully utilize and maximize its growing capacity while also expanding its genetics to a total of 31 approved strains from the previously approved three strains. We've already completed our first harvest under new cultivation license. We expect to commercialize these products in Q2. We've also begun to supply our international markets with EU GMP-certified medical cannabis products from our Canadian facilities. With medical cannabis from Aphria Diamond launching in Poland and Broken Coast and Redecan launching in Australia. We expect to launch additional cultivation from Broken Coast and Aphria Diamond in the coming months. And finally, we'll continue to identify and enter new markets with the potential to generate material revenue and profit opportunities. We expect European opportunities could represent a potential $45 billion medical market over the long term. And with our presence in Europe, it allows Tilray to grow our global brand portfolio to a base of over 700 million people in Europe, which is twice the population in the U.S. Finally, let's discuss our Tilray Wellness business, focused on improving people's lives through the power of hemp. Tilray Wellness is represented mainly by Manitoba Harvest, our leading hemp brand with over a 53% market share in branded hemp products. Wellness is also comprised of Happy Flower beverages and HiBall energy drinks. In Q1, Tilray Wellness delivered 11% net revenue growth compared to the prior year, driven by strong core business sales coupled with hemp innovation and the expansion into wellness beverages. A strong focus on cost helped the business improve margins, delivering a 300 basis point increase in gross margin to 32%. As Tilray Brands has transformed, expanded and completed numerous acquisitions to get where we are today, our mission has evolved to be a leading premium lifestyle company with a house of brands and innovation of products that inspire joy, wellness, and create memorable experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carl to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Carl?\\n\\nCarl Merton: Thank you, Irwin. As a reminder, our financial results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. Let's now review our quarterly performance for the three months ended August 31, 2024. In Q1 net revenue was $200 million, a 13% growth rate compared to the previous year quarter net revenue of $177 million. As Irwin stated, our Q1 net revenue was a record amount. In constant currency, net revenue grew to $204 million. By segment, beverage alcohol net revenue increased 132% to $56 million. Cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million as a result of our strong focus on margins and strategic growth in key markets, which I will discuss in a moment. Distribution net revenue was flat and wellness net revenue rose 11% in the quarter. From a segment perspective, 28% of our net revenue was generated by our beverage alcohol business, 31% was generated by our cannabis business, 34% by our distribution business, and 7% by our wellness business. This compares to 13% in beverage alcohol, 40% in cannabis, 39% in distribution, and 8% in wellness in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance is due to our craft beverage acquisition, which occurred in Q2 of last year. Gross profit increased by 35% to $59.7 million compared to $44.2 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased to 30%, and over 500 basis point increase from the prior year period. Adjusted gross profit increased 21% to $59.9 million from $49.3 million in the prior year, while adjusted gross margin increased by 200 basis points to 30%, primarily reflecting our focus on improving our utilizations at our beverage alcohol facilities and favorable sales mix. Net loss improved by 38% to $34.7 million compared to a net loss of $55.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a per share basis, this amounted to a net loss of $0.04 per share, which was a 60% improvement compared to a net loss of $0.10 per share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss was $6.1 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $27.1 million in the prior year quarter, a 78% improvement year-over-year with adjusted net loss per share coming in at negative $0.01 per share, a significant beat compared to expectations of negative $0.05. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million compared to $10.7 million in the prior year quarter. We are now approaching six consecutive years of generating positive adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA from the prior year quarter is primarily related to building infrastructure and an increased investment in marketing and promotions at Tilray Beverages. Cash flow used in operations was $35.3 million compared to $15.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was negative $39.5 million compared to negative $6.3 million in the prior year quarter as a result of an increased demand on our working capital in our beverage operations as we moved from the payment terms under the co-manufacturing agreements to our own payment terms after integrating production. Turning now to our four business segments. Beverage alcohol net revenue was $56 million, up 132% from $24.2 million in the prior year. The positive delta was due to contributions from the craft brands which were purchased during Q2 of last year and new innovations across our brand portfolio. Through our expanding footprint, we now own and operate 20 brewpubs/restaurants in the U.S., that are in close proximity to the production of our craft brands. In the quarter these operations contributed $11 million of revenue, and we expect them to be a key part of our strategy going forward allowing us to increase brand visibility and gain an intimate understanding of our key consumers. Beverage alcohol gross profit increased to $22.9 million compared to $12.9 million and adjusted gross profit was $23.1 million compared to $13.5 million. While Beverage alcohol gross margin was 41% compared to 53%, and adjusted gross margin was 41% from 56% from the prior year quarter. Due to the seasonality of our Beverage business, our third quarter ended February 29, 2024 is our most comparable period, reflecting the newly acquired craft brands to which we improved adjusted gross margin by over 300 basis points as a result of our efforts in integrating and optimizing our facilities as well as a favorable product mix. As we mentioned at year-end, the new craft brands were initially subject to co-manufacturing agreements, inhibiting our ability to optimize production and control costs in a manner sufficient to increase our gross profit and margin. Effective May 31, all the co-manufacturing agreements except for production of Shock Top ended and the production of the brands were in-house, with Shock Top's production expected to be integrated into our production facilities in Q2. As we integrate production in-house, we are able to better optimize production utilization in our facilities, decreasing unabsorbed overheads as well as achieving purchase price synergies now that we are purchasing the raw ingredients. Gross cannabis revenue of $81.2 million was comprised of $57.2 million in Canadian adult-use revenue, $12.2 million in International cannabis revenue, $6.3 million in Canadian medical cannabis revenue and $5.5 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue, which includes $20 million in excise taxes was $61.2 million, representing a 13% decrease from the year-ago period. Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis grew 2%, despite the category being impacted by competition from the adult-use market, while revenue from Canadian adult-use decreased 20%, which was a result of our increased focus on preserving gross margin and maintaining a higher average selling price in categories that have experienced a high degree of price compression. International cannabis revenue decreased by 14%, which was largely driven by variability on the timing in countries other than Germany of receiving import and export permits, resulting in fluctuations on a quarterly basis. As Irwin said already, in the five months since legalization versus the five months before legalization, our Flower revenues in Germany are up 50%, and our extract sales are up 22%. As I mentioned, cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million, but down $9.1 million versus the prior year. As we focus on our goal of improving cannabis gross margins, we are intentionally less focused on share and revenue in certain categories, particularly those categories facing the most price compression, including infused, pre-roll, and vape. Despite the decline in net revenue and share in those categories, we increased cannabis gross profit by $4.4 million and increased adjusted cannabis gross margin by over 500 basis points from the prior year period. Cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million and cannabis gross margin was 40%. Adjusted cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior year quarter. The gross margin increase was driven by our International cannabis business, and in Canada, our continued focus on maintaining a higher average selling price and selling a favorable product mix to improve adjusted gross margins by 500 basis points. Distribution net revenue derived predominantly through Tilray Pharma was $68.1 million, compared to $69.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net revenue is attributed to the effects of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, revenue from distribution increased to $70.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of $69.2 million for the prior year period. Distribution gross profit increased to $7.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior year period. While distribution gross margin increased to 12% from 11% in the prior year quarter, because of product mix. Wellness net revenue grew 11% to $14.8 million from $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by our strategic focus on continued innovations and strong organic growth within our branded hemp business related to higher consumption. Wellness gross profit was $4.7 million, up from $3.8 million in the prior year quarter, and gross margin rose to 32% compared to 29%, a result of decreased input costs and continued operational efficiencies. Our cash and marketable securities balance as of October 31 was $280.1 million, up from $260.5 million at year-end. This change was a result of our temporary increase in working capital dependence, offset by the funds raised from our ATM. Since its initiation, we have raised $94.5 million on our ATM, which we intend to use for strategic and accretive acquisitions, including capital expenditures for acquired businesses. Let me now conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\\n\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can I ask a bit about the Canadian adult-use market and just how volumes are trending?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Blair is on the phone. I'll let him jump in a second. But I think the big thing which you see in Canada, how we've improved our margins there tremendously, and with Canada now being legal for five years, there's a lot of LPs that have come and gone and with us having 5 million square feet in Canada and being one of the largest and being the number one, there's a lot of volume, but the volume we're going to go after is profitable low volume and there's sales that we'll give up for. In the period, we introduced a lot of new products, a lot of new innovation. And what we've done with our facilities in regards to our yields, in regards to some of the products that we're doing today and the amount of pre-rolls, we sell over 80 million pre-rolls a year. We sell over 350 metric tons of flower a year. So volume is absolutely dependent, but it's profitable volume. Blair, you want to add anything to it?\\n\\nBlair MacNeil: Yes. Thanks, Irwin. And good question. In the industry overall, I would say, dollar volume is, as Irwin just talked about, compressed by some of the growth in those categories. But dollar volume is up 4.5% to 5% overall. If you look at the kgs shipped or the volume overall, the category is growing at 9% to 10%. So, we're still seeing healthy amounts of consumers come into the categories. We're seeing healthy amounts of growth in the business. I think what you're seeing is the offset of price compression. What we've made on choices that you heard in the results from Irwin and Carl is to not play as aggressively in those distillate and distillate-infused categories, which are margin challenged. So overall, I would say, the business is very healthy on the overall industry from a volume standpoint and a dollar volume standpoint still growing at about 5% on the dollar side. And then on the Tilray side, we're being very choiceful on how we balance our margin and our volume.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I think the big important thing is to realize is a couple of things. Number one, where you still pay a flat excise tax in Canada, you heard Carl say, we pay over $20 million in excise tax in the quarter. We pay close to $150 million for a full year. There's still definitely some price compression, but we're not going to play in areas where it's just all about price. And that's the big focus. The other thing is, our teams have done a great job of taking costs out and getting the yields on our grow, getting the yields on our products, and educating consumers. They're going to have to pay a little more for the quality products they're getting.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. Useful. And then maybe just update on where we are on price compression and maybe the balance of supply?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So let me just come back and say to this here. The interesting thing, as you go back and look over the last three years, we probably, in Canada, lost well over $200 million on price compression. And I'm not making excuses, that number drops to your bottom line. If you come back and look at ultimately excise tax being cut, and it was half, there's an extra $50 million, $70 million. So I think we're seeing price compression stabilize. In regards to inventories, with our growth today in our yields, and us ultimately balancing and right sizing our facilities, I think we're in a great state, a great place today in regards to what our inventories are. And the market continues to change dramatically in regards to potency. And that is a big thing today, it's amazing, and they're looking for 30% plus potencies today. And if you can grow it, you can sell it. And I think that's what's important, and we got caught a little on potencies on our good supply, and we saw some great growth in the quarter with regards to higher potencies in our good supply brand.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Great. Thanks, guys.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: And the last thing, just let me add there. It's five years now that cannabis is legal in Canada. Actually, it's five years what October 18 or something like that, coming up, the anniversary. The consumer now is educated, and we've had to build these brands from scratch. So these brands where brands that have been built from scratch, good supply is over a $200 plus million brand at retail, and educate -- the consumer there is educated today about quality, potency, genetics, and where the product comes from. And that's something Tilray has done an incredible job in making sure that we put great products out there. And listen, we still have a lot of restrictions in the packaging, how we advertise the products, how we communicate to our consumers.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. So, first, I just want to talk a high-level one in terms of how you're thinking about investing in the business and also driving profitable growth. You laid out a number of initiatives throughout the business. So I wanted to talk about how you're thinking about that. And then EBITDA growth throughout the year was down a bit in the first quarter. So how best to think about the levers and the cadence of EBITDA and what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, we come back, and this probably is one of our lowest quarters in the year. There's seasonality, which I don't think everybody looks at. There's also acquisitions, like in this quarter, there's nothing on the Molson Coors acquisition that we closed in early September. And in regards to rolling out new products, there's timing on that. In regards to our Delta-9 products in our beverage division, in regards to our non-alc, in regards to our Liquid Love, in regards to some of our other new products. So again, there is seasonality and there's timing on a lot of the new products in regards to the distribution of white space. The other big thing that's not in here is a lot of the costs that we're still taking out of this business with the integration of the ABI brands, a lot of costs still coming out in regards to our Canadian business. And in Europe, there's a lot happening there with Germany. Our flower business was up since the announcement of the new regulations in flower, Germany almost 50%. There's a time elapse of when we get products into the marketplace. There's a time elapse when products are shipped into the Poland market and some of the other ones. So a lot of it is just from a timing standpoint and the seasonality and our new products rolling out.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Okay, thanks, Irwin. That's helpful color. Second question for me, just on the Hemp-Derived THC beverages. You laid out a number of states in your prepared remarks. You had previously said two states. I just want to clarify, those states in your prepared remarks are those where you'll be distributing at brick-and-mortar or just DTC? And then secondly, just on Hemp-Derived beverages, how best to think about the ramping with brick-and-mortar and the impact of bills that have been introduced and the broader farm bill, which looks like it might be delayed another year, and how that's impacting broader distribution? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So in regards to Delta-9, it's basically going to be brick-and-mortar. We've already received our first orders and the majority of it will be rolled out into retailers and through our beer distributors that can sell it. Some will be definitely direct-to-consumer, but there's 19 states today that will allow this product. And we're pretty excited about the orders already and the demand for the product. And a lot more to come. We have five great products that we're going to roll out. So it will be basically sold direct -- it will basically be sold at retail these products, and through our beer distributors. Some will go through with our Happy Flower will be direct-to-consumer.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Good morning, everyone. Appreciate a lot of the commentary on sort of individual markets in Europe and how things are progressing on the regulatory front and even with respect to some demand. But I'm just curious, without getting into too specific, into the nitty-gritty of any numbers or anything, but if you look at your international contribution, both exports, boots on the ground, it's been run rating at close to about $50 million for a little while now. And I'm just wondering if any of these changes on the regulatory front are expected to have a meaningful impact on that contribution by the end of your fiscal year?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, I'll let Denise jump in here for a second, but I got to tell you, you've heard what I said in Germany, since the changes in regulations, our flower business was up almost 50%. And in regards to supply, and that's been some of our biggest constraints here some supply, we supply from our Canadian operations, we supply from our Portugal and some of the changes that we now have in Germany where we can sell out of our German facility where before we only could sell through the German government. So there's a lot of pieces in place, but listen, there's only 20 different countries that allow medical cannabis in Europe. And I think there is some tremendous opportunity to see the size of the category in billions. The demand is there. Denise, do you want to add to what I said?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Yes, sure. Thanks, Irwin. And I just do -- I do thank you for the question. I just want to challenge, like the one part about it running at $50 million for a few years now, because actually, I think if you look back over the progression, we actually have seen pretty significant growth year-over-year. If you look basically from the point of time of the Tilray acquisition up until our reported numbers from last year, and we're expecting very, very significant growth in this year's market. As we look to our -- by fiscal year '25, as Irwin mentioned, we had 50% growth in our flower business, 22% in our extract business, where we already have a sizable market share. We do have some, as Irwin mentioned in the previous question, we have some timing with import-export permits receiving in certain countries where we ship directly to a distributor versus our own warehouses, and therefore servicing markets through third-party distributors. So there will be some lumpiness. So it's really important to look at the business on a year -- on a year basis, not necessarily on a quarter basis, to get a full picture.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay, got it. Appreciate all that. And then I just wanted to sort of more of a general question, but just given some of the growth headwinds in the domestic Canadian market, obviously, there's been a lot of attention paid, and you guys have done a lot of good strategic initiatives, whether it's International or Beverage alcohol. But on the Wellness side of things, I'm just curious if there's any sort of M&A opportunities you think within there, or do you think this is more of a sort of organic growth story from the exposure you guys already have?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, in regards to Wellness, I think, listen, there's a lot of the medical in Canada that's coming over, and they're going into the -- you know, going into recreational and buying it there. But medical is something that we're focused on. We see tremendous use for the product, whether it's anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy. So there's a big medical opportunity for us. Is there acquisitions for us in that area? That is an area that we are focused on in regards to the medical part of the business. But I think the whole thing is, again, is our research that we're focused on medical, which is a big commitment for us. And being the number one medical producer in Europe, there's a lot we're learning there, and there's a lot as we work with universities and research that we're sharing back and forth, matter of fact, we're in Europe next week with our Canadian teams and our European teams working on multiple things there. So, yes, medical is a big part of our growth, and medical is something that's very, very important to us in the Canadian market.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay. Thanks all.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Good morning. I don't think I heard the fiscal '25 revenue guidance, which had been $950 million to $1 billion. Is that still the expectation for the year? And then, if I recall, that guidance had included some M&A, some expectation for some M&A, was the recent acquisition of the brands from Molson Coors, the M&A that was contemplated in that guidance, or is there still more implied?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So that was the guidance for the year. There is some M&A in there. We have not updated our guidance to include the Molson's acquisition.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Okay. And then on the International side, like I understand that it's up over a few years, it has been in that like, $11 million to $14 million on a per quarter basis for a little while, despite new positive developments. So, like what's offsetting the new positive developments in kind of on a more narrow timeframe?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: So thank you for the question. The international business, basically, if you remember, we used to actually, there's been some ins and outs, I think, in terms of the business. So it's not exactly on apples-to-apples. If you recall, a couple of years ago, Israel was actually a very big part of our revenue number. And if you might remember that it's been about a year and a half ago, two years ago, we discontinued our business in Israel. Just given the state of the market there, given the influx of products, the price compression, we just didn't feel that it was a profitable market for us to continue. So we discontinued those sales, which were quite sizable. However, in replacing that, we have sought out additional new countries. We entered Poland, we entered the U.K., Italy and Portugal. We've also identified a bunch of other countries which we will be entering. So stay tuned for that in future quarters. This business, as Irwin mentioned before, the Canadian business was just a few years old. The business in Europe is even more underdeveloped and immature at this point. And so, in essence, it really is just starting to grow and take off now. And so, I think it's still early innings for this business. We are very bullish about it going forward. And as Irwin mentioned, we look to invest -- we've already invested and we will continue to invest.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I just think, again, you got to come back, there's been some currency effect in Europe that affected us, as you look at it. But Denise mentioned, as we look at this from a profitability, Europe is very profitable for us. And I think that's what's very important is as we focus on profitability. The other thing is Germany being the biggest market there, and we were restricted with our facility in Germany that we only could sell to the German government at a loss. That has changed. So we were losing money in regards to a tender that was awarded five years ago, and we've been able to renegotiate that tender and renegotiate the terms of that. The second thing is, as each country legalizes, and we're not dealing with states here, we're dealing with different countries with different regulatory. So building out the European market absolutely has been difficult. And there's markets that we've abandoned. We are not selling into the Israeli market, which used to be one of the biggest markets for us. So, what I can reassure you is, there's tremendous opportunities of growth. We only really sell flower and tinctures. It's not like we're selling pre-rolls and we're selling multiple different products here. We're selling over 100 different products, but it's basically flower and tinctures, and that's it. So we look for Europe to be a big opportunity. We are the largest grower of cannabis in Europe today. We have the infrastructure on the ground, taking a little time, but what's important to us is the profitability there. The other thing is we're vertically integrated with our CC Pharma, CC -- our Tilray Pharma there in regards to distributing through the drugstores. So, yes, you know, it's not growing as fast, but it is a very profitable business for us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the Delta-9 beverages. It's been tough in the cannabis space at least, really, building brands that kind of parallel to how they've developed in other categories. And so this is an interesting case to see how it plays out. But I guess with that in mind, you have four brands, I think you mentioned, you've got teed up and more to come. Why so many? And how do you plan to develop those and set them up for sustainable growth?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, the brands are developed, and again we've had Happy Flower out there for a long time with CBD 420 is one of our brands that are known. Two or three of our other brands have some uniqueness to them. So, again, with our five different products out there, it gives us differentiation in products, it allows us to have multiple products out there. And so far, everything we have shown retailers, distributors, they've liked, and we got quite a few orders. So, yes, 420 is a brand that's well-known out there. Happy Flower has been out there. We have to build some of our other brands out there, and we've done that before, as we've come out with new products in regards to Runner's High, which is our non-alc beer and our Montauk non-alc beer, our Liquid Love is our water brand that's coming out there. Our Delta-9, our new brand. Listen, the big thing is out there. We got products. We've developed these flavors. We developed these products from scratch. We got 700 distributors out there, and these distributors want it now, we only can sell it in the states that is legal. And we got field salespeople out there on the street that will make sure we get this product in the hands. The last but not least, which is important, how do we market that to the consumer? And that's what's important for us to make sure we're getting the message across to the consumer. There's some really good products that we're coming up with.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Yes, no, so that's helpful. And then just on some of the -- you touched on some of the integration of beer production and how you've got more flexibility now. How significant can that be and how quickly could it come in terms of just, would we be right to think that you could consolidate some facilities or how do we just think about what to expect in the next several quarters for how that impacts your numbers?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, no, good question there. Listen, we're in a category today where the craft beer industry is declining 3%, but there's $100 billion worth of beer sold out there. So it's not like a small category. So there is tremendous opportunities in the craft beer business, okay? And with that, we think we can go out there and take share with innovation, with some of the new products that we've launched. We think we come back and look at whether it's the non-alc industry that's growing tremendously within Delta-9. The other thing is, we're going back to each of our brands today. We have 19 brands out there, and we're looking at these brands where they should be sold regionally and what should be a national brand. Shock Top definitely should be a national brand. But if you take Montauk, you take Blue Point and take SweetWater, and you focus them sort of in the Northeast, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, maybe Florida, that's over 100 million people that we can market our brands to. We don't need to be in every single state out there and ship 10,000, 20,000 cases there, spend money on it where we're not going to get the lift. If you come back and look at SweetWater, SweetWater grew a 2.5 million, 3 million case brand. But it went into certain states, whether it's Ohio or Illinois, it didn't make sense in those states, California. So what we're going to do is take these brands, focus on three, four, five states, put our money behind them, work with the distributors, educate the consumers about them, and then take our national brands like a Shock Top. And the other thing, what we're going to look at this here, if we have a pumpkin beer, we'll have pumpkin beer in similar flavors for Montauk, for Blue Point. We're not going to have all these multiple different formulas out there with a lot of complexity. So we're looking at how we take our tail of our brands. We're looking at how to take complexity out of our business. We're going to do some SKU rationalization. And with this, it will optimize and right-size our footprint and the buying power today with over 15 million cases of beer that we're buying. And if we have to consolidate some of our facilities, which we're right now looking at, we ultimately will, but we really feel, you know, within a matter since 2020, we're now the fifth largest craft brewer out there with a 5% share out there. And we think we can get this category growing again through our innovation, through our distribution. And I got to tell you, working with distributors out there, they all want to see growth, they all want to see new innovation, they want to see products. And the same with the retailers. The retailers are looking at there's way too many brands, way too many products, how do we ultimately get this category growing, because it takes up too much space in stores.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Irwin, maybe can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about U.S. plan touching assets? We've seen other companies that set up ring fence structures, Canopy USA, SNDL with SunStream, OGI has talked about that also. I mean, there's been more consolidation, and we would come to a point that there won't be much left to buy. So how do you handicap that? And how do you think about, you know, doing something similar in the current context of regulation?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So I step back, and listen, the good news is the two presidential candidates are in favor of legalization. And I think in regards to rescheduling, there's, in December, the recommendations are going to come up on that. So, Pablo, I think something will happen in regards to rescheduling, and something will happen in regards to Federal legalization, whether it's medical cannabis that will be legalized and ultimately leave it up to the states for everything else. If you come back and look at what we can do, remember, we've gone in once Canada was legalized five years ago, they tell me it's six years ago, but I think it's still five, it was 2018, so I guess that is six years ago. If you come back and look at it, we built our Canadian business to a $300-plus million business from scratch. And we built it -- we built grow facilities, we built brands, we built vertical integration. And today, as being one of the largest growers up there with almost 5 million square feet, we know how to grow cannabis. We know we have the genetic base. We know how to -- you know, make pre-rolls, we know how to make tinctures, we know how to make drinks. We'll sell this year close to 9 million cans of cannabis-infused drinks. So we have, you know, the DNA, we have the know-how. You know we're one of the largest medical cannabis companies in Canada and in Europe. So with that, we're ready to do it on our own in the U.S., depending upon what the guidelines and the parameters are. And on the other hand, with our balance sheet, where it is today, we have the ability to go out and acquire a great strategic partner that can help us, but that makes sense. The other thing in the U.S. today, we have 18 beer brands or 19 beer brands. We have multiple brands in our spirits business, and we have our wellness brand in Manitoba Harvest. Can these brands parlay over into the cannabis category like we're doing with some of these in Delta-9? So again, I think, with cannabis going to legalize, and that's my opinion, I have nothing else, you know, any other insight, we will be ready to jump into which way we can jump in there and be ready for it.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. And one last one, maybe for Denise, just going back to the discussion in Germany, maybe using some Michael Porter's terms here, but maybe remind us of your competitive advantage there, your competitive assets, your asset strengths. What are the barriers to entry? Because what I hear, there's all these licensed importers that are able to bring products, we saw a big jump apparently in imports in the second and third quarter, and then they are able to go to doctors, promote those products, and sell them to the consumers, right? So I don't know if I want to see more fragmentation as opposed to consolidation in Germany. But I'm sure you have assets on the ground that give you an advantage. But I'm just trying to understand how the German market plays out in terms of fragmentation versus consolidation. Just importers versus local producers. And what's your edge? And why should we assume that you are better positioned than others? If you can just mention that. And as part of that, a quick reminder, if you produce, if you jump production in Germany by five times, I suppose that replaces Portugal or Canada, does that mean that you end up with a higher cost structure? Thank you.\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Thanks, Pablo, and thank you for the question. I think, also I just want to also bring back to the previous question that was asked, because I think it -- I was remiss in not stating the fact that if you look at our year-over-year growth between FY24 and FY23 in terms of the European market, we grew that market 34%. So I just wanted to actually finish off that last question, which I didn't do the last time. In terms of Germany, I think you are 100% right in terms of our uniquely positioned in Germany and in Europe, in particular. We mentioned Aphria RX facility with our ability under our new -- our newly issued license, we have the ability to produce to full capacity, which basically allows us to produce five times what we were able to produce under the tender. In addition, we expanded that license, under the tender we were permitted to produce three strains. Today, we now are able to do 31 cultivars, and I'm proud to say that actually what just landed at Neumunster is a bunch of cultivars from our Canadian facilities, where we look at those cultivars that perform best in market in Canada. And we've shipped those cultivars over to both Portugal and Aphria RX in order to provide ourselves with the maximum flexibility both in supply chain, as well as the availability of products to patients. Having that facility, as well as our Portugal facility, as well as we've opened up the ability to deliver product from Canada, we have the -- probably what I would -- what I would classify as the most flexible supply chain of any cannabis company in Europe where we see many of -- and you mentioned about whether there's segmentation and consolidation, and as you know, there is a few larger players in the Canadian -- in the German market, but there's, and then there's a proliferation of a lot of smaller, smaller companies that are -- that are coming online and starting and continue in German market. I do think at some point there will be consolidation, just because if you have a lot of players in a market, you will start to see consolidation of those players. But going back to our unique position, we have the most flexible supply chain, we have a great cost structure. Given the work that we've done in order to make sure that we always keep our cost to produce very low and we're very efficient. In addition, we have a terrific first-class commercial team located in Europe and with boots on the ground in Germany. We have a sales team that is very well positioned in terms of their knowledge, their reputation with doctors, their reputation with government officials, and the fact of the matter of being one of the first in Germany has given us a reputation of being trusted and having the expertise. So as doctors want to learn more and more about medical cannabis in light of the new regulations, we are one of the first that they seek out in order to get that information because they want to know how to prescribe and they want to know how to continue in the market.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the quarterly results in beverage. I didn't hear whether you said that those -- the sales were in line or a little below expectations. I think you said cannabis was in line or better. So can you just tell us like, just how did beverage do versus you thought? The tracking data shows the brands are down a bit. Do they just need like -- is it a matter of timing before your new marketing efforts and your consolidation efforts take hold before the retail sales get a little bit better?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, Robert, thank you. We don't give guidance out there by the major businesses, but we have definitely internal guidance and internal budgets. The beverage business was off a bit and a lot of that is just timing on some of the new products and a lot of it is the products are ready, it's when the distributors ultimately take them, and that was the biggest thing. The other thing which you heard me talk about earlier is right-sizing the business here and going through our SKU rationalization, going through our brand rationalization, and going through our distribution white space. Also there is timing in regards to customers taking new products in, products for Halloween, products -- our pumping products, and some of the different things like that. So just a timing standpoint. But the other one was integration of some of the ABI brands back into our facilities and supplies. So it's just from a timing standpoint, it's a timing standpoint. If you look at our quarterly -- if you look at our numbers here, our SG&A was way up in regards to our beverage business. But as we build out the infrastructure and build out people and take over the ABI business and do some of the spending, we expect to get the benefits from that over the year. So with that, we are excited to what we see that's happening out there. We think we're well positioned with our brands, with our products, with our innovation. Our customers are giving us good feedback. We have a lot of high hopes for Delta-9, we have a lot of high hopes for our non-alc, we have a lot of hopes for our Liquid Love. We'll have a lot of hopes for some of the new innovation that's coming out under SweetWater, Montauk, and 10 Barrel, and which, again, which is not really in our numbers, with the acquisition that we just acquired, the four brands from Molson Coors, and getting our hands around them and seeing the growth opportunities with that. So with that, it's just early timing in regards to our beverage business, but there is a real, real, real good plan in place there, Robert.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Simon for any final comments.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you very much, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud and excited of what we've been able to put together over the last five-plus years. As you heard our guidance out there is $950 million to $1 billion of size, and that's coming from a startup basically at $50 million. Today, we have over 44 brands. We have 2,700 people that work within this company today. We have plenty facilities, we sell in over 20 countries, six different continents. And again, we are dealing in categories where regulation is important. There is no one company out there that does what we do as diversified as us. So it's not easy. And there's a lot of noise and a lot of news every day coming up about cannabis. As we sit here and wait, there's a lot of changes that got to happen. But again, the cannabis industry in the U.S. is over $40-plus billion in total size. So there's a big, big, big market out there. You look at the total beer industry out there and the size just of the craft industry, there's a big business out there. You look at the wellness industry and some of the stuff that we're doing with hemp and that grew about 11% in the quarter. So we're well positioned. If you come back and look at our balance sheet, and that's something I think that's hurt a lot of other companies out there in the cannabis industry, is we really have managed our balance sheet, managed our cash situation, managed paying down debt. In our last quarter, we paid down over $300 million of our convertible debt. So we're focused on this and pulling all this together. Are we totally happy with our stock performance? No. But I don't think it reflects of what this company has done over the last five years and how we put together some great brands, great people, a great strategy, and how we're diversified out there. And we're a global company in the CPG industry. So, I feel there's exciting times ahead. You have great brands, you have a really committed team. We have a tight, tight strategy out there. We have great partners with our distributors, our retailers, our consumers, who we're marketing to. And last but not least, our aim is to please our shareholders and reward our shareholders. With that, thank you very much and enjoy your day. Go Mets, go Yankees. And you go to Citi Field, you'll find our beer. You go to San Diego, you'll find our beers. So we want stadiums that are in the playoffs that are selling our beers. So with that, be safe out there, and thank you for joining us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\",\n",

The company's diverse portfolio, spanning cannabis, beverages, and wellness products, has contributed to its robust performance.\\n\\nThe beverage alcohol segment showed exceptional growth, with revenue increasing by 132% to $56 million. This growth was driven by the company's craft beer brands and new non-alcoholic offerings. Tilray has established itself as the fifth-largest craft beer producer in the U.S., holding a 5% market share.\\n\\nIn the cannabis sector, Tilray maintains its leadership position in Canada and is expanding its international presence, particularly in Germany. Following the implementation of the new Cannabis Act in Germany on April 1, 2024, Tilray's medical flower sales increased by 50%. The company received the first commercial cannabis cultivation and distribution licenses in Germany, enabling a fivefold production increase.\\n\\nTilray's financial position remains strong, with cash and marketable securities of $280.1 million.

This is particularly relevant given Tilray's ambitious revenue projections and its focus on growth in international markets, especially Germany.\\n\\nWhile Tilray reported a net loss of $34.7 million in Q1, an improvement from the previous year, the InvestingPro Tip suggests that analysts predict the company will be profitable this year.

This volatility is evident in the company's year-to-date price total return of -30.87% as of the data provided. Investors should consider this volatility in the context of Tilray's growth strategy and market expansion efforts.\\n\\nFor readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights beyond those mentioned here.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands Chairman and CEO, Irwin Simon.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you, Berrin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the last five years, Tilray Brands has evolved into a new company. We no longer are just a Canadian cannabis LP. Tilray Brands has grown tremendously, and we're setting a new precedent for the CPG industry. Not only have we set the stage for a new era of consumer habits, Tilray Brands has pushed forward, disrupting the global CPG industry and revolutionizing consumer products. Tilray is at the forefront of innovation, pioneering and leading the convergence of beverages, cannabis, hemp, wellness, and distribution industries on a global scale. Our operations span over 20 countries and five continents with 44 consumer-connected lifestyle brands and 20 vertically integrated facilities that produce approximately 90% of our products in-house, ensuring the highest quality of our products. Tilray continues to lead with the number one cannabis business in Canada, leading medical cannabis business across Europe, the number one branded hemp business in North America, and the fifth-largest craft beer business in the U.S. Our success in building a new era of consumer products that resonates with today's discerning consumers and caters to their ever-evolving consumption habits and transforming the way consumers eat, drink and unwind with cannabis, hemp, and beverage products is a testament to our commitment on delivering innovative products that meets the needs of the modern consumer and drive growth across industries. Moving on to Q1, we achieved our record first-quarter net revenue results, while strengthening our operations, increasing gross margin, and increasing our gross profit. We hit net revenue of $200 million, representing a 13% growth year-over-year. Our gross profit increased by 35% and gross margin increased by over 500 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Our beverage business, including craft beer, spirits, and our new non-alc beers and other non-alcoholic drinks grew 132% in net revenue year-over-year. We strengthened our leadership position as the fifth-largest U.S. craft beer brewer with a 5% market share as a result of our craft acquisition from ABI. We recently launched a new beverage division called Tilray Alternative Beverages, focused on fueling key markets across the U.S., with innovative federally legal, hemp derivative Delta 9, THC branded, and branded products. This is an exciting new segment for us, and our network of distributors, which I'll get into in more detail shortly. We focused our cannabis business on strengthening our operations and increasing our margins, leading to a gross profit increasing by 22%. We continue to lead the branded hemp food industry with a 52% branded market share, with Manitoba Harvest in the U.S. and the Canadian market share of nearly 80%. And our financial foundation remains strong with a robust balance sheet, ample cash reserves, reduced debt levels and flexibility to explore potential new acquisitions. Our financial strength enables us to pursue new opportunities and capitalize on emerging trends in the market. Let's now dive deeper into each of our business segments. Starting with Tilray Beverages. Today, our Beverage division leads with 19 iconic brands, ten network manufacturing facilities and over 700 distributors, 20 brewpubs and restaurants, and leading sales and marketing teams across the U.S. Our beverage strategy is focused on growing our portfolio brands in selected states, regional markets and ensuring product excellence and innovation, driving focused scale, expanding targeted distribution to increase our market penetration and consumer access. In our Beverage segment we generated $56 million of net revenue in Q1. Across our growing craft brands, SweetWater is the number one volume brand family in Georgia, multi-outlet and convenience stores. Montauk is the number one branded family in New York Metro, having increased at a rate of sale of 240 basis points year-over-year. And Tilray is the number one craft supplier in the Pacific Northwest, thanks in part to the continued success of 10 Barrel's Pub Beer, Shock Top remains a leading priority as we relaunch the brand's number one seasonal offering, Shock Top Pretzel. During Q1 and Q2, driving additional 5,000 distribution points in the last 45 days. The Pacific Northwest grew overall Shock Top distribution by 42% during the Q1, adding 1,100 new placements for the brand. In the Northeast, Montauk's flagship Wave Chaser IPA continues to post positive year-over-year volume distribution gains adding a net of 139 off-premise accounts during Q1. Three of SweetWater's top 12-pack SKUs, 420 Pale Ale, OG IPA and the Hazy IPA all posted positive trends for Q1 trending a plus 7%, a plus 24% and a plus 17%, respectively. As we've mentioned before, our ambition is far beyond our current reach, as we continue our focus to become a dominant leading beverage business by leveraging and are strengthening our portfolio of beloved local craft brands, recruiting new customers, and activating more occasions, driving new growth across these brands. Additionally, we are innovating across adjacent categories, including flavored malt beverages, ready-to-drink cocktails, spirits, and also beyond alcohol, we will grow our non-alc beer category and expand further into water, energy and other categories. Our powerful college sports partnerships across the country will be leveraged to bring new LDA consumers and fans into different brand families, especially Shock Top. Separately, our MLS music events and local community partnerships allow our brands to recruit and retain our core customers across different age groups. We have the manufacturing facilities, the distribution, the sales and marketing infrastructure to drive tremendous growth in the Tilray Beverages business. In the non-alcoholic segment, Montauk non-alc craft beer is now sold in 650 counts and new brand, Runner's High Brewing Company has launched in the Southeast with three brews; Runner's High Golden Wheat, Raspberry Wheat, and Dark Chocolate, with several expansion markets to follow. With over 700 beer distributors, Tilray is now a leading supplier in key regions across the U.S., with regional jewels in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, and the Southeast. With each beverage acquisition we've made over the past few years, SweetWater, Green Flash, Alpine, Montauk Brewing, the craft acquisitions from ABI and most recently, the acquisitions of our four brands in Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). We are laser-focused on operational efficiency, optimizing cost structure, and getting the margins of the acquired brands up above 40%, like SweetWater and our other legacy businesses, we've identified additional growth opportunities in our beverage business. Tilray Beverage is going after category diversification and we've identified four categories. We expect to generate $30 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025. These four categories include: light lagers, $117 million category; flavored malt beverages, a $4.7 billion category; sparkling water, a $12 billion category; and the non-alc brew, a $445 million category. With our recent launch of Tilray Alternative Beverages, we are focused on fueling the U.S. with Hemp-Derived Delta-9 beverages, which is an estimated $2.8 billion market in the U.S. We're beginning to launch our Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC brands and products in key states including Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee with distribution driven by our existing and robust beer distribution network. Our initial portfolio of HDD9 brands include Happy Flower, Herb & Bloom, [420 Hops], Fizzy Jane and we expect to launch additional brands by the end of this calendar year. Happy Flower is currently available online through Drink Happy Flower. The growth of Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC drink business in the U.S. is remarkable. And we are excited to see its potential for our beer distribution network who are eager to jump into the business and already have begun placing orders. We look forward to sharing more updates on this development soon. Turning to Tilray Cannabis. In Canada, Tilray continues to lead the Canadian market share by almost 170 bps over the next competitor and have been consistently at the top of the industry for the past three years. From a regional perspective, Tilray is number one across British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. These provinces combined include over 86% of the Canadian population. We've also led in all other markets combined. In adult-use recreational cannabis, we focus on margin improvement across our portfolio brands and products resulting in improved adjusted gross margin by 500 basis points in Q1 versus last year. The margin improvement, partnered with efficient utilization, production, and further cost savings initiatives will allow us to grow our revenue, profitability, sustainability well into the future. In Q1 20% of our net sales revenue came from new innovation. Our mainstream Flower business continued to grow, because of our strong genetics. Our Redecan brand moved up to the number six position brand in Canada as reported by Hifyre data. In Beverages, Tilray continues to dominate the beverage category with a 45% market share, and at the end of August, with XMG, Mollo, THC beverage brands being the number one and number two brands, respectively. Tilray shipped 78 metric tons of biomass, or approximately 25% of the implied Canadian market volume in Q1. We continue to leverage the wholesale channel where contribution margins are better and supply is starting to balance. On an adult-rec we shipped 16 million pre-rolled cones and over 2.1 million cans of beverages in Q1. Turning to our International business in Q1, we continue to execute against our three basic initiatives. First, the acceleration of growth in Germany. In Germany, since the Cannabis Act went into effect on April 1, 2024, we've seen a 50% increase in medical flower sales, as well as a 22% increase in medical cannabis extracts, where we already have a dominant share of the market, and we believe that our current positioning in Germany provides us with several unique competitive advantages to capture a significant share of the expected medical cannabis market, which is projected to be approximately $3 billion in the medium term. We expect to continue our growth in this very important market through commercial excellence and increased supply. We will continue to leverage the expertise and relationship of our CC Pharma / Tilray Pharma distribution business in Germany, which supports our medical cannabis business through its network of 13,000 pharmacy and wholesalers. Second, the bifurcation and differentiation of physician-led and patient-led channels. As a market leader in the physician-led channel, we're turning our focus to accelerating our growth in the patient-led channel. One of our major initiatives in this regard is improving the availability and the quality of our medical cannabis supply to meet needs of patients-led channels by creating a flexible and diversified supply chain focused on high-quality flower and new innovation. At Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Rx, our German cultivation and processing facility, we received the very first commercial cannabis cultivation license and commercial distribution license issued in Germany under the new regulations. These new license granted Tilray the ability to cultivate, produce, and distribute premium quality medical cannabis, with the ability to increase our production by approximately 5 times. Aphria RX can now fully utilize and maximize its growing capacity while also expanding its genetics to a total of 31 approved strains from the previously approved three strains. We've already completed our first harvest under new cultivation license. We expect to commercialize these products in Q2. We've also begun to supply our international markets with EU GMP-certified medical cannabis products from our Canadian facilities. With medical cannabis from Aphria Diamond launching in Poland and Broken Coast and Redecan launching in Australia. We expect to launch additional cultivation from Broken Coast and Aphria Diamond in the coming months. And finally, we'll continue to identify and enter new markets with the potential to generate material revenue and profit opportunities. We expect European opportunities could represent a potential $45 billion medical market over the long term. And with our presence in Europe, it allows Tilray to grow our global brand portfolio to a base of over 700 million people in Europe, which is twice the population in the U.S. Finally, let's discuss our Tilray Wellness business, focused on improving people's lives through the power of hemp. Tilray Wellness is represented mainly by Manitoba Harvest, our leading hemp brand with over a 53% market share in branded hemp products. Wellness is also comprised of Happy Flower beverages and HiBall energy drinks. In Q1, Tilray Wellness delivered 11% net revenue growth compared to the prior year, driven by strong core business sales coupled with hemp innovation and the expansion into wellness beverages. A strong focus on cost helped the business improve margins, delivering a 300 basis point increase in gross margin to 32%. As Tilray Brands has transformed, expanded and completed numerous acquisitions to get where we are today, our mission has evolved to be a leading premium lifestyle company with a house of brands and innovation of products that inspire joy, wellness, and create memorable experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carl to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Carl?\\n\\nCarl Merton: Thank you, Irwin. As a reminder, our financial results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. Let's now review our quarterly performance for the three months ended August 31, 2024. In Q1 net revenue was $200 million, a 13% growth rate compared to the previous year quarter net revenue of $177 million. As Irwin stated, our Q1 net revenue was a record amount. In constant currency, net revenue grew to $204 million. By segment, beverage alcohol net revenue increased 132% to $56 million. Cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million as a result of our strong focus on margins and strategic growth in key markets, which I will discuss in a moment. Distribution net revenue was flat and wellness net revenue rose 11% in the quarter. From a segment perspective, 28% of our net revenue was generated by our beverage alcohol business, 31% was generated by our cannabis business, 34% by our distribution business, and 7% by our wellness business. This compares to 13% in beverage alcohol, 40% in cannabis, 39% in distribution, and 8% in wellness in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance is due to our craft beverage acquisition, which occurred in Q2 of last year. Gross profit increased by 35% to $59.7 million compared to $44.2 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased to 30%, and over 500 basis point increase from the prior year period. Adjusted gross profit increased 21% to $59.9 million from $49.3 million in the prior year, while adjusted gross margin increased by 200 basis points to 30%, primarily reflecting our focus on improving our utilizations at our beverage alcohol facilities and favorable sales mix. Net loss improved by 38% to $34.7 million compared to a net loss of $55.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a per share basis, this amounted to a net loss of $0.04 per share, which was a 60% improvement compared to a net loss of $0.10 per share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss was $6.1 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $27.1 million in the prior year quarter, a 78% improvement year-over-year with adjusted net loss per share coming in at negative $0.01 per share, a significant beat compared to expectations of negative $0.05. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million compared to $10.7 million in the prior year quarter. We are now approaching six consecutive years of generating positive adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA from the prior year quarter is primarily related to building infrastructure and an increased investment in marketing and promotions at Tilray Beverages. Cash flow used in operations was $35.3 million compared to $15.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was negative $39.5 million compared to negative $6.3 million in the prior year quarter as a result of an increased demand on our working capital in our beverage operations as we moved from the payment terms under the co-manufacturing agreements to our own payment terms after integrating production. Turning now to our four business segments. Beverage alcohol net revenue was $56 million, up 132% from $24.2 million in the prior year. The positive delta was due to contributions from the craft brands which were purchased during Q2 of last year and new innovations across our brand portfolio. Through our expanding footprint, we now own and operate 20 brewpubs/restaurants in the U.S., that are in close proximity to the production of our craft brands. In the quarter these operations contributed $11 million of revenue, and we expect them to be a key part of our strategy going forward allowing us to increase brand visibility and gain an intimate understanding of our key consumers. Beverage alcohol gross profit increased to $22.9 million compared to $12.9 million and adjusted gross profit was $23.1 million compared to $13.5 million. While Beverage alcohol gross margin was 41% compared to 53%, and adjusted gross margin was 41% from 56% from the prior year quarter. Due to the seasonality of our Beverage business, our third quarter ended February 29, 2024 is our most comparable period, reflecting the newly acquired craft brands to which we improved adjusted gross margin by over 300 basis points as a result of our efforts in integrating and optimizing our facilities as well as a favorable product mix. As we mentioned at year-end, the new craft brands were initially subject to co-manufacturing agreements, inhibiting our ability to optimize production and control costs in a manner sufficient to increase our gross profit and margin. Effective May 31, all the co-manufacturing agreements except for production of Shock Top ended and the production of the brands were in-house, with Shock Top's production expected to be integrated into our production facilities in Q2. As we integrate production in-house, we are able to better optimize production utilization in our facilities, decreasing unabsorbed overheads as well as achieving purchase price synergies now that we are purchasing the raw ingredients. Gross cannabis revenue of $81.2 million was comprised of $57.2 million in Canadian adult-use revenue, $12.2 million in International cannabis revenue, $6.3 million in Canadian medical cannabis revenue and $5.5 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue, which includes $20 million in excise taxes was $61.2 million, representing a 13% decrease from the year-ago period. Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis grew 2%, despite the category being impacted by competition from the adult-use market, while revenue from Canadian adult-use decreased 20%, which was a result of our increased focus on preserving gross margin and maintaining a higher average selling price in categories that have experienced a high degree of price compression. International cannabis revenue decreased by 14%, which was largely driven by variability on the timing in countries other than Germany of receiving import and export permits, resulting in fluctuations on a quarterly basis. As Irwin said already, in the five months since legalization versus the five months before legalization, our Flower revenues in Germany are up 50%, and our extract sales are up 22%. As I mentioned, cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million, but down $9.1 million versus the prior year. As we focus on our goal of improving cannabis gross margins, we are intentionally less focused on share and revenue in certain categories, particularly those categories facing the most price compression, including infused, pre-roll, and vape. Despite the decline in net revenue and share in those categories, we increased cannabis gross profit by $4.4 million and increased adjusted cannabis gross margin by over 500 basis points from the prior year period. Cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million and cannabis gross margin was 40%. Adjusted cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior year quarter. The gross margin increase was driven by our International cannabis business, and in Canada, our continued focus on maintaining a higher average selling price and selling a favorable product mix to improve adjusted gross margins by 500 basis points. Distribution net revenue derived predominantly through Tilray Pharma was $68.1 million, compared to $69.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net revenue is attributed to the effects of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, revenue from distribution increased to $70.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of $69.2 million for the prior year period. Distribution gross profit increased to $7.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior year period. While distribution gross margin increased to 12% from 11% in the prior year quarter, because of product mix. Wellness net revenue grew 11% to $14.8 million from $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by our strategic focus on continued innovations and strong organic growth within our branded hemp business related to higher consumption. Wellness gross profit was $4.7 million, up from $3.8 million in the prior year quarter, and gross margin rose to 32% compared to 29%, a result of decreased input costs and continued operational efficiencies. Our cash and marketable securities balance as of October 31 was $280.1 million, up from $260.5 million at year-end. This change was a result of our temporary increase in working capital dependence, offset by the funds raised from our ATM. Since its initiation, we have raised $94.5 million on our ATM, which we intend to use for strategic and accretive acquisitions, including capital expenditures for acquired businesses. Let me now conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\\n\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can I ask a bit about the Canadian adult-use market and just how volumes are trending?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Blair is on the phone. I'll let him jump in a second. But I think the big thing which you see in Canada, how we've improved our margins there tremendously, and with Canada now being legal for five years, there's a lot of LPs that have come and gone and with us having 5 million square feet in Canada and being one of the largest and being the number one, there's a lot of volume, but the volume we're going to go after is profitable low volume and there's sales that we'll give up for. In the period, we introduced a lot of new products, a lot of new innovation. And what we've done with our facilities in regards to our yields, in regards to some of the products that we're doing today and the amount of pre-rolls, we sell over 80 million pre-rolls a year. We sell over 350 metric tons of flower a year. So volume is absolutely dependent, but it's profitable volume. Blair, you want to add anything to it?\\n\\nBlair MacNeil: Yes. Thanks, Irwin. And good question. In the industry overall, I would say, dollar volume is, as Irwin just talked about, compressed by some of the growth in those categories. But dollar volume is up 4.5% to 5% overall. If you look at the kgs shipped or the volume overall, the category is growing at 9% to 10%. So, we're still seeing healthy amounts of consumers come into the categories. We're seeing healthy amounts of growth in the business. I think what you're seeing is the offset of price compression. What we've made on choices that you heard in the results from Irwin and Carl is to not play as aggressively in those distillate and distillate-infused categories, which are margin challenged. So overall, I would say, the business is very healthy on the overall industry from a volume standpoint and a dollar volume standpoint still growing at about 5% on the dollar side. And then on the Tilray side, we're being very choiceful on how we balance our margin and our volume.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I think the big important thing is to realize is a couple of things. Number one, where you still pay a flat excise tax in Canada, you heard Carl say, we pay over $20 million in excise tax in the quarter. We pay close to $150 million for a full year. There's still definitely some price compression, but we're not going to play in areas where it's just all about price. And that's the big focus. The other thing is, our teams have done a great job of taking costs out and getting the yields on our grow, getting the yields on our products, and educating consumers. They're going to have to pay a little more for the quality products they're getting.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. Useful. And then maybe just update on where we are on price compression and maybe the balance of supply?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So let me just come back and say to this here. The interesting thing, as you go back and look over the last three years, we probably, in Canada, lost well over $200 million on price compression. And I'm not making excuses, that number drops to your bottom line. If you come back and look at ultimately excise tax being cut, and it was half, there's an extra $50 million, $70 million. So I think we're seeing price compression stabilize. In regards to inventories, with our growth today in our yields, and us ultimately balancing and right sizing our facilities, I think we're in a great state, a great place today in regards to what our inventories are. And the market continues to change dramatically in regards to potency. And that is a big thing today, it's amazing, and they're looking for 30% plus potencies today. And if you can grow it, you can sell it. And I think that's what's important, and we got caught a little on potencies on our good supply, and we saw some great growth in the quarter with regards to higher potencies in our good supply brand.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Great. Thanks, guys.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: And the last thing, just let me add there. It's five years now that cannabis is legal in Canada. Actually, it's five years what October 18 or something like that, coming up, the anniversary. The consumer now is educated, and we've had to build these brands from scratch. So these brands where brands that have been built from scratch, good supply is over a $200 plus million brand at retail, and educate -- the consumer there is educated today about quality, potency, genetics, and where the product comes from. And that's something Tilray has done an incredible job in making sure that we put great products out there. And listen, we still have a lot of restrictions in the packaging, how we advertise the products, how we communicate to our consumers.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. So, first, I just want to talk a high-level one in terms of how you're thinking about investing in the business and also driving profitable growth. You laid out a number of initiatives throughout the business. So I wanted to talk about how you're thinking about that. And then EBITDA growth throughout the year was down a bit in the first quarter. So how best to think about the levers and the cadence of EBITDA and what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, we come back, and this probably is one of our lowest quarters in the year. There's seasonality, which I don't think everybody looks at. There's also acquisitions, like in this quarter, there's nothing on the Molson Coors acquisition that we closed in early September. And in regards to rolling out new products, there's timing on that. In regards to our Delta-9 products in our beverage division, in regards to our non-alc, in regards to our Liquid Love, in regards to some of our other new products. So again, there is seasonality and there's timing on a lot of the new products in regards to the distribution of white space. The other big thing that's not in here is a lot of the costs that we're still taking out of this business with the integration of the ABI brands, a lot of costs still coming out in regards to our Canadian business. And in Europe, there's a lot happening there with Germany. Our flower business was up since the announcement of the new regulations in flower, Germany almost 50%. There's a time elapse of when we get products into the marketplace. There's a time elapse when products are shipped into the Poland market and some of the other ones. So a lot of it is just from a timing standpoint and the seasonality and our new products rolling out.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Okay, thanks, Irwin. That's helpful color. Second question for me, just on the Hemp-Derived THC beverages. You laid out a number of states in your prepared remarks. You had previously said two states. I just want to clarify, those states in your prepared remarks are those where you'll be distributing at brick-and-mortar or just DTC? And then secondly, just on Hemp-Derived beverages, how best to think about the ramping with brick-and-mortar and the impact of bills that have been introduced and the broader farm bill, which looks like it might be delayed another year, and how that's impacting broader distribution? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So in regards to Delta-9, it's basically going to be brick-and-mortar. We've already received our first orders and the majority of it will be rolled out into retailers and through our beer distributors that can sell it. Some will be definitely direct-to-consumer, but there's 19 states today that will allow this product. And we're pretty excited about the orders already and the demand for the product. And a lot more to come. We have five great products that we're going to roll out. So it will be basically sold direct -- it will basically be sold at retail these products, and through our beer distributors. Some will go through with our Happy Flower will be direct-to-consumer.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Good morning, everyone. Appreciate a lot of the commentary on sort of individual markets in Europe and how things are progressing on the regulatory front and even with respect to some demand. But I'm just curious, without getting into too specific, into the nitty-gritty of any numbers or anything, but if you look at your international contribution, both exports, boots on the ground, it's been run rating at close to about $50 million for a little while now. And I'm just wondering if any of these changes on the regulatory front are expected to have a meaningful impact on that contribution by the end of your fiscal year?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, I'll let Denise jump in here for a second, but I got to tell you, you've heard what I said in Germany, since the changes in regulations, our flower business was up almost 50%. And in regards to supply, and that's been some of our biggest constraints here some supply, we supply from our Canadian operations, we supply from our Portugal and some of the changes that we now have in Germany where we can sell out of our German facility where before we only could sell through the German government. So there's a lot of pieces in place, but listen, there's only 20 different countries that allow medical cannabis in Europe. And I think there is some tremendous opportunity to see the size of the category in billions. The demand is there. Denise, do you want to add to what I said?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Yes, sure. Thanks, Irwin. And I just do -- I do thank you for the question. I just want to challenge, like the one part about it running at $50 million for a few years now, because actually, I think if you look back over the progression, we actually have seen pretty significant growth year-over-year. If you look basically from the point of time of the Tilray acquisition up until our reported numbers from last year, and we're expecting very, very significant growth in this year's market. As we look to our -- by fiscal year '25, as Irwin mentioned, we had 50% growth in our flower business, 22% in our extract business, where we already have a sizable market share. We do have some, as Irwin mentioned in the previous question, we have some timing with import-export permits receiving in certain countries where we ship directly to a distributor versus our own warehouses, and therefore servicing markets through third-party distributors. So there will be some lumpiness. So it's really important to look at the business on a year -- on a year basis, not necessarily on a quarter basis, to get a full picture.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay, got it. Appreciate all that. And then I just wanted to sort of more of a general question, but just given some of the growth headwinds in the domestic Canadian market, obviously, there's been a lot of attention paid, and you guys have done a lot of good strategic initiatives, whether it's International or Beverage alcohol. But on the Wellness side of things, I'm just curious if there's any sort of M&A opportunities you think within there, or do you think this is more of a sort of organic growth story from the exposure you guys already have?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, in regards to Wellness, I think, listen, there's a lot of the medical in Canada that's coming over, and they're going into the -- you know, going into recreational and buying it there. But medical is something that we're focused on. We see tremendous use for the product, whether it's anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy. So there's a big medical opportunity for us. Is there acquisitions for us in that area? That is an area that we are focused on in regards to the medical part of the business. But I think the whole thing is, again, is our research that we're focused on medical, which is a big commitment for us. And being the number one medical producer in Europe, there's a lot we're learning there, and there's a lot as we work with universities and research that we're sharing back and forth, matter of fact, we're in Europe next week with our Canadian teams and our European teams working on multiple things there. So, yes, medical is a big part of our growth, and medical is something that's very, very important to us in the Canadian market.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay. Thanks all.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Good morning. I don't think I heard the fiscal '25 revenue guidance, which had been $950 million to $1 billion. Is that still the expectation for the year? And then, if I recall, that guidance had included some M&A, some expectation for some M&A, was the recent acquisition of the brands from Molson Coors, the M&A that was contemplated in that guidance, or is there still more implied?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So that was the guidance for the year. There is some M&A in there. We have not updated our guidance to include the Molson's acquisition.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Okay. And then on the International side, like I understand that it's up over a few years, it has been in that like, $11 million to $14 million on a per quarter basis for a little while, despite new positive developments. So, like what's offsetting the new positive developments in kind of on a more narrow timeframe?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: So thank you for the question. The international business, basically, if you remember, we used to actually, there's been some ins and outs, I think, in terms of the business. So it's not exactly on apples-to-apples. If you recall, a couple of years ago, Israel was actually a very big part of our revenue number. And if you might remember that it's been about a year and a half ago, two years ago, we discontinued our business in Israel. Just given the state of the market there, given the influx of products, the price compression, we just didn't feel that it was a profitable market for us to continue. So we discontinued those sales, which were quite sizable. However, in replacing that, we have sought out additional new countries. We entered Poland, we entered the U.K., Italy and Portugal. We've also identified a bunch of other countries which we will be entering. So stay tuned for that in future quarters. This business, as Irwin mentioned before, the Canadian business was just a few years old. The business in Europe is even more underdeveloped and immature at this point. And so, in essence, it really is just starting to grow and take off now. And so, I think it's still early innings for this business. We are very bullish about it going forward. And as Irwin mentioned, we look to invest -- we've already invested and we will continue to invest.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I just think, again, you got to come back, there's been some currency effect in Europe that affected us, as you look at it. But Denise mentioned, as we look at this from a profitability, Europe is very profitable for us. And I think that's what's very important is as we focus on profitability. The other thing is Germany being the biggest market there, and we were restricted with our facility in Germany that we only could sell to the German government at a loss. That has changed. So we were losing money in regards to a tender that was awarded five years ago, and we've been able to renegotiate that tender and renegotiate the terms of that. The second thing is, as each country legalizes, and we're not dealing with states here, we're dealing with different countries with different regulatory. So building out the European market absolutely has been difficult. And there's markets that we've abandoned. We are not selling into the Israeli market, which used to be one of the biggest markets for us. So, what I can reassure you is, there's tremendous opportunities of growth. We only really sell flower and tinctures. It's not like we're selling pre-rolls and we're selling multiple different products here. We're selling over 100 different products, but it's basically flower and tinctures, and that's it. So we look for Europe to be a big opportunity. We are the largest grower of cannabis in Europe today. We have the infrastructure on the ground, taking a little time, but what's important to us is the profitability there. The other thing is we're vertically integrated with our CC Pharma, CC -- our Tilray Pharma there in regards to distributing through the drugstores. So, yes, you know, it's not growing as fast, but it is a very profitable business for us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the Delta-9 beverages. It's been tough in the cannabis space at least, really, building brands that kind of parallel to how they've developed in other categories. And so this is an interesting case to see how it plays out. But I guess with that in mind, you have four brands, I think you mentioned, you've got teed up and more to come. Why so many? And how do you plan to develop those and set them up for sustainable growth?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, the brands are developed, and again we've had Happy Flower out there for a long time with CBD 420 is one of our brands that are known. Two or three of our other brands have some uniqueness to them. So, again, with our five different products out there, it gives us differentiation in products, it allows us to have multiple products out there. And so far, everything we have shown retailers, distributors, they've liked, and we got quite a few orders. So, yes, 420 is a brand that's well-known out there. Happy Flower has been out there. We have to build some of our other brands out there, and we've done that before, as we've come out with new products in regards to Runner's High, which is our non-alc beer and our Montauk non-alc beer, our Liquid Love is our water brand that's coming out there. Our Delta-9, our new brand. Listen, the big thing is out there. We got products. We've developed these flavors. We developed these products from scratch. We got 700 distributors out there, and these distributors want it now, we only can sell it in the states that is legal. And we got field salespeople out there on the street that will make sure we get this product in the hands. The last but not least, which is important, how do we market that to the consumer? And that's what's important for us to make sure we're getting the message across to the consumer. There's some really good products that we're coming up with.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Yes, no, so that's helpful. And then just on some of the -- you touched on some of the integration of beer production and how you've got more flexibility now. How significant can that be and how quickly could it come in terms of just, would we be right to think that you could consolidate some facilities or how do we just think about what to expect in the next several quarters for how that impacts your numbers?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, no, good question there. Listen, we're in a category today where the craft beer industry is declining 3%, but there's $100 billion worth of beer sold out there. So it's not like a small category. So there is tremendous opportunities in the craft beer business, okay? And with that, we think we can go out there and take share with innovation, with some of the new products that we've launched. We think we come back and look at whether it's the non-alc industry that's growing tremendously within Delta-9. The other thing is, we're going back to each of our brands today. We have 19 brands out there, and we're looking at these brands where they should be sold regionally and what should be a national brand. Shock Top definitely should be a national brand. But if you take Montauk, you take Blue Point and take SweetWater, and you focus them sort of in the Northeast, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, maybe Florida, that's over 100 million people that we can market our brands to. We don't need to be in every single state out there and ship 10,000, 20,000 cases there, spend money on it where we're not going to get the lift. If you come back and look at SweetWater, SweetWater grew a 2.5 million, 3 million case brand. But it went into certain states, whether it's Ohio or Illinois, it didn't make sense in those states, California. So what we're going to do is take these brands, focus on three, four, five states, put our money behind them, work with the distributors, educate the consumers about them, and then take our national brands like a Shock Top. And the other thing, what we're going to look at this here, if we have a pumpkin beer, we'll have pumpkin beer in similar flavors for Montauk, for Blue Point. We're not going to have all these multiple different formulas out there with a lot of complexity. So we're looking at how we take our tail of our brands. We're looking at how to take complexity out of our business. We're going to do some SKU rationalization. And with this, it will optimize and right-size our footprint and the buying power today with over 15 million cases of beer that we're buying. And if we have to consolidate some of our facilities, which we're right now looking at, we ultimately will, but we really feel, you know, within a matter since 2020, we're now the fifth largest craft brewer out there with a 5% share out there. And we think we can get this category growing again through our innovation, through our distribution. And I got to tell you, working with distributors out there, they all want to see growth, they all want to see new innovation, they want to see products. And the same with the retailers. The retailers are looking at there's way too many brands, way too many products, how do we ultimately get this category growing, because it takes up too much space in stores.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Irwin, maybe can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about U.S. plan touching assets? We've seen other companies that set up ring fence structures, Canopy USA, SNDL with SunStream, OGI has talked about that also. I mean, there's been more consolidation, and we would come to a point that there won't be much left to buy. So how do you handicap that? And how do you think about, you know, doing something similar in the current context of regulation?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So I step back, and listen, the good news is the two presidential candidates are in favor of legalization. And I think in regards to rescheduling, there's, in December, the recommendations are going to come up on that. So, Pablo, I think something will happen in regards to rescheduling, and something will happen in regards to Federal legalization, whether it's medical cannabis that will be legalized and ultimately leave it up to the states for everything else. If you come back and look at what we can do, remember, we've gone in once Canada was legalized five years ago, they tell me it's six years ago, but I think it's still five, it was 2018, so I guess that is six years ago. If you come back and look at it, we built our Canadian business to a $300-plus million business from scratch. And we built it -- we built grow facilities, we built brands, we built vertical integration. And today, as being one of the largest growers up there with almost 5 million square feet, we know how to grow cannabis. We know we have the genetic base. We know how to -- you know, make pre-rolls, we know how to make tinctures, we know how to make drinks. We'll sell this year close to 9 million cans of cannabis-infused drinks. So we have, you know, the DNA, we have the know-how. You know we're one of the largest medical cannabis companies in Canada and in Europe. So with that, we're ready to do it on our own in the U.S., depending upon what the guidelines and the parameters are. And on the other hand, with our balance sheet, where it is today, we have the ability to go out and acquire a great strategic partner that can help us, but that makes sense. The other thing in the U.S. today, we have 18 beer brands or 19 beer brands. We have multiple brands in our spirits business, and we have our wellness brand in Manitoba Harvest. Can these brands parlay over into the cannabis category like we're doing with some of these in Delta-9? So again, I think, with cannabis going to legalize, and that's my opinion, I have nothing else, you know, any other insight, we will be ready to jump into which way we can jump in there and be ready for it.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. And one last one, maybe for Denise, just going back to the discussion in Germany, maybe using some Michael Porter's terms here, but maybe remind us of your competitive advantage there, your competitive assets, your asset strengths. What are the barriers to entry? Because what I hear, there's all these licensed importers that are able to bring products, we saw a big jump apparently in imports in the second and third quarter, and then they are able to go to doctors, promote those products, and sell them to the consumers, right? So I don't know if I want to see more fragmentation as opposed to consolidation in Germany. But I'm sure you have assets on the ground that give you an advantage. But I'm just trying to understand how the German market plays out in terms of fragmentation versus consolidation. Just importers versus local producers. And what's your edge? And why should we assume that you are better positioned than others? If you can just mention that. And as part of that, a quick reminder, if you produce, if you jump production in Germany by five times, I suppose that replaces Portugal or Canada, does that mean that you end up with a higher cost structure? Thank you.\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Thanks, Pablo, and thank you for the question. I think, also I just want to also bring back to the previous question that was asked, because I think it -- I was remiss in not stating the fact that if you look at our year-over-year growth between FY24 and FY23 in terms of the European market, we grew that market 34%. So I just wanted to actually finish off that last question, which I didn't do the last time. In terms of Germany, I think you are 100% right in terms of our uniquely positioned in Germany and in Europe, in particular. We mentioned Aphria RX facility with our ability under our new -- our newly issued license, we have the ability to produce to full capacity, which basically allows us to produce five times what we were able to produce under the tender. In addition, we expanded that license, under the tender we were permitted to produce three strains. Today, we now are able to do 31 cultivars, and I'm proud to say that actually what just landed at Neumunster is a bunch of cultivars from our Canadian facilities, where we look at those cultivars that perform best in market in Canada. And we've shipped those cultivars over to both Portugal and Aphria RX in order to provide ourselves with the maximum flexibility both in supply chain, as well as the availability of products to patients. Having that facility, as well as our Portugal facility, as well as we've opened up the ability to deliver product from Canada, we have the -- probably what I would -- what I would classify as the most flexible supply chain of any cannabis company in Europe where we see many of -- and you mentioned about whether there's segmentation and consolidation, and as you know, there is a few larger players in the Canadian -- in the German market, but there's, and then there's a proliferation of a lot of smaller, smaller companies that are -- that are coming online and starting and continue in German market. I do think at some point there will be consolidation, just because if you have a lot of players in a market, you will start to see consolidation of those players. But going back to our unique position, we have the most flexible supply chain, we have a great cost structure. Given the work that we've done in order to make sure that we always keep our cost to produce very low and we're very efficient. In addition, we have a terrific first-class commercial team located in Europe and with boots on the ground in Germany. We have a sales team that is very well positioned in terms of their knowledge, their reputation with doctors, their reputation with government officials, and the fact of the matter of being one of the first in Germany has given us a reputation of being trusted and having the expertise. So as doctors want to learn more and more about medical cannabis in light of the new regulations, we are one of the first that they seek out in order to get that information because they want to know how to prescribe and they want to know how to continue in the market.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the quarterly results in beverage. I didn't hear whether you said that those -- the sales were in line or a little below expectations. I think you said cannabis was in line or better. So can you just tell us like, just how did beverage do versus you thought? The tracking data shows the brands are down a bit. Do they just need like -- is it a matter of timing before your new marketing efforts and your consolidation efforts take hold before the retail sales get a little bit better?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, Robert, thank you. We don't give guidance out there by the major businesses, but we have definitely internal guidance and internal budgets. The beverage business was off a bit and a lot of that is just timing on some of the new products and a lot of it is the products are ready, it's when the distributors ultimately take them, and that was the biggest thing. The other thing which you heard me talk about earlier is right-sizing the business here and going through our SKU rationalization, going through our brand rationalization, and going through our distribution white space. Also there is timing in regards to customers taking new products in, products for Halloween, products -- our pumping products, and some of the different things like that. So just a timing standpoint. But the other one was integration of some of the ABI brands back into our facilities and supplies. So it's just from a timing standpoint, it's a timing standpoint. If you look at our quarterly -- if you look at our numbers here, our SG&A was way up in regards to our beverage business. But as we build out the infrastructure and build out people and take over the ABI business and do some of the spending, we expect to get the benefits from that over the year. So with that, we are excited to what we see that's happening out there. We think we're well positioned with our brands, with our products, with our innovation. Our customers are giving us good feedback. We have a lot of high hopes for Delta-9, we have a lot of high hopes for our non-alc, we have a lot of hopes for our Liquid Love. We'll have a lot of hopes for some of the new innovation that's coming out under SweetWater, Montauk, and 10 Barrel, and which, again, which is not really in our numbers, with the acquisition that we just acquired, the four brands from Molson Coors, and getting our hands around them and seeing the growth opportunities with that. So with that, it's just early timing in regards to our beverage business, but there is a real, real, real good plan in place there, Robert.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Simon for any final comments.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you very much, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud and excited of what we've been able to put together over the last five-plus years. As you heard our guidance out there is $950 million to $1 billion of size, and that's coming from a startup basically at $50 million. Today, we have over 44 brands. We have 2,700 people that work within this company today. We have plenty facilities, we sell in over 20 countries, six different continents. And again, we are dealing in categories where regulation is important. There is no one company out there that does what we do as diversified as us. So it's not easy. And there's a lot of noise and a lot of news every day coming up about cannabis. As we sit here and wait, there's a lot of changes that got to happen. But again, the cannabis industry in the U.S. is over $40-plus billion in total size. So there's a big, big, big market out there. You look at the total beer industry out there and the size just of the craft industry, there's a big business out there. You look at the wellness industry and some of the stuff that we're doing with hemp and that grew about 11% in the quarter. So we're well positioned. If you come back and look at our balance sheet, and that's something I think that's hurt a lot of other companies out there in the cannabis industry, is we really have managed our balance sheet, managed our cash situation, managed paying down debt. In our last quarter, we paid down over $300 million of our convertible debt. So we're focused on this and pulling all this together. Are we totally happy with our stock performance? No. But I don't think it reflects of what this company has done over the last five years and how we put together some great brands, great people, a great strategy, and how we're diversified out there. And we're a global company in the CPG industry. So, I feel there's exciting times ahead. You have great brands, you have a really committed team. We have a tight, tight strategy out there. We have great partners with our distributors, our retailers, our consumers, who we're marketing to. And last but not least, our aim is to please our shareholders and reward our shareholders. With that, thank you very much and enjoy your day. Go Mets, go Yankees. And you go to Citi Field, you'll find our beer. You go to San Diego, you'll find our beers. So we want stadiums that are in the playoffs that are selling our beers. So with that, be safe out there, and thank you for joining us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\",\n",

Tilray has established itself as the fifth-largest craft beer producer in the U.S., holding a 5% market share.\\n\\nIn the cannabis sector, Tilray maintains its leadership position in Canada and is expanding its international presence, particularly in Germany.

This is particularly relevant given Tilray's ambitious revenue projections and its focus on growth in international markets, especially Germany.\\n\\nWhile Tilray reported a net loss of $34.7 million in Q1, an improvement from the previous year, the InvestingPro Tip suggests that analysts predict the company will be profitable this year. This aligns with Tilray's positive outlook and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2025.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Tilray's stock price movements are quite volatile, according to another InvestingPro Tip. This volatility is evident in the company's year-to-date price total return of -30.87% as of the data provided.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands Chairman and CEO, Irwin Simon.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you, Berrin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the last five years, Tilray Brands has evolved into a new company. We no longer are just a Canadian cannabis LP. Tilray Brands has grown tremendously, and we're setting a new precedent for the CPG industry. Not only have we set the stage for a new era of consumer habits, Tilray Brands has pushed forward, disrupting the global CPG industry and revolutionizing consumer products. Tilray is at the forefront of innovation, pioneering and leading the convergence of beverages, cannabis, hemp, wellness, and distribution industries on a global scale. Our operations span over 20 countries and five continents with 44 consumer-connected lifestyle brands and 20 vertically integrated facilities that produce approximately 90% of our products in-house, ensuring the highest quality of our products. Tilray continues to lead with the number one cannabis business in Canada, leading medical cannabis business across Europe, the number one branded hemp business in North America, and the fifth-largest craft beer business in the U.S. Our success in building a new era of consumer products that resonates with today's discerning consumers and caters to their ever-evolving consumption habits and transforming the way consumers eat, drink and unwind with cannabis, hemp, and beverage products is a testament to our commitment on delivering innovative products that meets the needs of the modern consumer and drive growth across industries. Moving on to Q1, we achieved our record first-quarter net revenue results, while strengthening our operations, increasing gross margin, and increasing our gross profit. We hit net revenue of $200 million, representing a 13% growth year-over-year. Our gross profit increased by 35% and gross margin increased by over 500 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Our beverage business, including craft beer, spirits, and our new non-alc beers and other non-alcoholic drinks grew 132% in net revenue year-over-year. We strengthened our leadership position as the fifth-largest U.S. craft beer brewer with a 5% market share as a result of our craft acquisition from ABI. We recently launched a new beverage division called Tilray Alternative Beverages, focused on fueling key markets across the U.S., with innovative federally legal, hemp derivative Delta 9, THC branded, and branded products. This is an exciting new segment for us, and our network of distributors, which I'll get into in more detail shortly. We focused our cannabis business on strengthening our operations and increasing our margins, leading to a gross profit increasing by 22%. We continue to lead the branded hemp food industry with a 52% branded market share, with Manitoba Harvest in the U.S. and the Canadian market share of nearly 80%. And our financial foundation remains strong with a robust balance sheet, ample cash reserves, reduced debt levels and flexibility to explore potential new acquisitions. Our financial strength enables us to pursue new opportunities and capitalize on emerging trends in the market. Let's now dive deeper into each of our business segments. Starting with Tilray Beverages. Today, our Beverage division leads with 19 iconic brands, ten network manufacturing facilities and over 700 distributors, 20 brewpubs and restaurants, and leading sales and marketing teams across the U.S. Our beverage strategy is focused on growing our portfolio brands in selected states, regional markets and ensuring product excellence and innovation, driving focused scale, expanding targeted distribution to increase our market penetration and consumer access. In our Beverage segment we generated $56 million of net revenue in Q1. Across our growing craft brands, SweetWater is the number one volume brand family in Georgia, multi-outlet and convenience stores. Montauk is the number one branded family in New York Metro, having increased at a rate of sale of 240 basis points year-over-year. And Tilray is the number one craft supplier in the Pacific Northwest, thanks in part to the continued success of 10 Barrel's Pub Beer, Shock Top remains a leading priority as we relaunch the brand's number one seasonal offering, Shock Top Pretzel. During Q1 and Q2, driving additional 5,000 distribution points in the last 45 days. The Pacific Northwest grew overall Shock Top distribution by 42% during the Q1, adding 1,100 new placements for the brand. In the Northeast, Montauk's flagship Wave Chaser IPA continues to post positive year-over-year volume distribution gains adding a net of 139 off-premise accounts during Q1. Three of SweetWater's top 12-pack SKUs, 420 Pale Ale, OG IPA and the Hazy IPA all posted positive trends for Q1 trending a plus 7%, a plus 24% and a plus 17%, respectively. As we've mentioned before, our ambition is far beyond our current reach, as we continue our focus to become a dominant leading beverage business by leveraging and are strengthening our portfolio of beloved local craft brands, recruiting new customers, and activating more occasions, driving new growth across these brands. Additionally, we are innovating across adjacent categories, including flavored malt beverages, ready-to-drink cocktails, spirits, and also beyond alcohol, we will grow our non-alc beer category and expand further into water, energy and other categories. Our powerful college sports partnerships across the country will be leveraged to bring new LDA consumers and fans into different brand families, especially Shock Top. Separately, our MLS music events and local community partnerships allow our brands to recruit and retain our core customers across different age groups. We have the manufacturing facilities, the distribution, the sales and marketing infrastructure to drive tremendous growth in the Tilray Beverages business. In the non-alcoholic segment, Montauk non-alc craft beer is now sold in 650 counts and new brand, Runner's High Brewing Company has launched in the Southeast with three brews; Runner's High Golden Wheat, Raspberry Wheat, and Dark Chocolate, with several expansion markets to follow. With over 700 beer distributors, Tilray is now a leading supplier in key regions across the U.S., with regional jewels in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, and the Southeast. With each beverage acquisition we've made over the past few years, SweetWater, Green Flash, Alpine, Montauk Brewing, the craft acquisitions from ABI and most recently, the acquisitions of our four brands in Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). We are laser-focused on operational efficiency, optimizing cost structure, and getting the margins of the acquired brands up above 40%, like SweetWater and our other legacy businesses, we've identified additional growth opportunities in our beverage business. Tilray Beverage is going after category diversification and we've identified four categories. We expect to generate $30 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025. These four categories include: light lagers, $117 million category; flavored malt beverages, a $4.7 billion category; sparkling water, a $12 billion category; and the non-alc brew, a $445 million category. With our recent launch of Tilray Alternative Beverages, we are focused on fueling the U.S. with Hemp-Derived Delta-9 beverages, which is an estimated $2.8 billion market in the U.S. We're beginning to launch our Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC brands and products in key states including Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee with distribution driven by our existing and robust beer distribution network. Our initial portfolio of HDD9 brands include Happy Flower, Herb & Bloom, [420 Hops], Fizzy Jane and we expect to launch additional brands by the end of this calendar year. Happy Flower is currently available online through Drink Happy Flower. The growth of Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC drink business in the U.S. is remarkable. And we are excited to see its potential for our beer distribution network who are eager to jump into the business and already have begun placing orders. We look forward to sharing more updates on this development soon. Turning to Tilray Cannabis. In Canada, Tilray continues to lead the Canadian market share by almost 170 bps over the next competitor and have been consistently at the top of the industry for the past three years. From a regional perspective, Tilray is number one across British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. These provinces combined include over 86% of the Canadian population. We've also led in all other markets combined. In adult-use recreational cannabis, we focus on margin improvement across our portfolio brands and products resulting in improved adjusted gross margin by 500 basis points in Q1 versus last year. The margin improvement, partnered with efficient utilization, production, and further cost savings initiatives will allow us to grow our revenue, profitability, sustainability well into the future. In Q1 20% of our net sales revenue came from new innovation. Our mainstream Flower business continued to grow, because of our strong genetics. Our Redecan brand moved up to the number six position brand in Canada as reported by Hifyre data. In Beverages, Tilray continues to dominate the beverage category with a 45% market share, and at the end of August, with XMG, Mollo, THC beverage brands being the number one and number two brands, respectively. Tilray shipped 78 metric tons of biomass, or approximately 25% of the implied Canadian market volume in Q1. We continue to leverage the wholesale channel where contribution margins are better and supply is starting to balance. On an adult-rec we shipped 16 million pre-rolled cones and over 2.1 million cans of beverages in Q1. Turning to our International business in Q1, we continue to execute against our three basic initiatives. First, the acceleration of growth in Germany. In Germany, since the Cannabis Act went into effect on April 1, 2024, we've seen a 50% increase in medical flower sales, as well as a 22% increase in medical cannabis extracts, where we already have a dominant share of the market, and we believe that our current positioning in Germany provides us with several unique competitive advantages to capture a significant share of the expected medical cannabis market, which is projected to be approximately $3 billion in the medium term. We expect to continue our growth in this very important market through commercial excellence and increased supply. We will continue to leverage the expertise and relationship of our CC Pharma / Tilray Pharma distribution business in Germany, which supports our medical cannabis business through its network of 13,000 pharmacy and wholesalers. Second, the bifurcation and differentiation of physician-led and patient-led channels. As a market leader in the physician-led channel, we're turning our focus to accelerating our growth in the patient-led channel. One of our major initiatives in this regard is improving the availability and the quality of our medical cannabis supply to meet needs of patients-led channels by creating a flexible and diversified supply chain focused on high-quality flower and new innovation. At Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Rx, our German cultivation and processing facility, we received the very first commercial cannabis cultivation license and commercial distribution license issued in Germany under the new regulations. These new license granted Tilray the ability to cultivate, produce, and distribute premium quality medical cannabis, with the ability to increase our production by approximately 5 times. Aphria RX can now fully utilize and maximize its growing capacity while also expanding its genetics to a total of 31 approved strains from the previously approved three strains. We've already completed our first harvest under new cultivation license. We expect to commercialize these products in Q2. We've also begun to supply our international markets with EU GMP-certified medical cannabis products from our Canadian facilities. With medical cannabis from Aphria Diamond launching in Poland and Broken Coast and Redecan launching in Australia. We expect to launch additional cultivation from Broken Coast and Aphria Diamond in the coming months. And finally, we'll continue to identify and enter new markets with the potential to generate material revenue and profit opportunities. We expect European opportunities could represent a potential $45 billion medical market over the long term. And with our presence in Europe, it allows Tilray to grow our global brand portfolio to a base of over 700 million people in Europe, which is twice the population in the U.S. Finally, let's discuss our Tilray Wellness business, focused on improving people's lives through the power of hemp. Tilray Wellness is represented mainly by Manitoba Harvest, our leading hemp brand with over a 53% market share in branded hemp products. Wellness is also comprised of Happy Flower beverages and HiBall energy drinks. In Q1, Tilray Wellness delivered 11% net revenue growth compared to the prior year, driven by strong core business sales coupled with hemp innovation and the expansion into wellness beverages. A strong focus on cost helped the business improve margins, delivering a 300 basis point increase in gross margin to 32%. As Tilray Brands has transformed, expanded and completed numerous acquisitions to get where we are today, our mission has evolved to be a leading premium lifestyle company with a house of brands and innovation of products that inspire joy, wellness, and create memorable experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carl to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Carl?\\n\\nCarl Merton: Thank you, Irwin. As a reminder, our financial results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. Let's now review our quarterly performance for the three months ended August 31, 2024. In Q1 net revenue was $200 million, a 13% growth rate compared to the previous year quarter net revenue of $177 million. As Irwin stated, our Q1 net revenue was a record amount. In constant currency, net revenue grew to $204 million. By segment, beverage alcohol net revenue increased 132% to $56 million. Cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million as a result of our strong focus on margins and strategic growth in key markets, which I will discuss in a moment. Distribution net revenue was flat and wellness net revenue rose 11% in the quarter. From a segment perspective, 28% of our net revenue was generated by our beverage alcohol business, 31% was generated by our cannabis business, 34% by our distribution business, and 7% by our wellness business. This compares to 13% in beverage alcohol, 40% in cannabis, 39% in distribution, and 8% in wellness in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance is due to our craft beverage acquisition, which occurred in Q2 of last year. Gross profit increased by 35% to $59.7 million compared to $44.2 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased to 30%, and over 500 basis point increase from the prior year period. Adjusted gross profit increased 21% to $59.9 million from $49.3 million in the prior year, while adjusted gross margin increased by 200 basis points to 30%, primarily reflecting our focus on improving our utilizations at our beverage alcohol facilities and favorable sales mix. Net loss improved by 38% to $34.7 million compared to a net loss of $55.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a per share basis, this amounted to a net loss of $0.04 per share, which was a 60% improvement compared to a net loss of $0.10 per share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss was $6.1 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $27.1 million in the prior year quarter, a 78% improvement year-over-year with adjusted net loss per share coming in at negative $0.01 per share, a significant beat compared to expectations of negative $0.05. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million compared to $10.7 million in the prior year quarter. We are now approaching six consecutive years of generating positive adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA from the prior year quarter is primarily related to building infrastructure and an increased investment in marketing and promotions at Tilray Beverages. Cash flow used in operations was $35.3 million compared to $15.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was negative $39.5 million compared to negative $6.3 million in the prior year quarter as a result of an increased demand on our working capital in our beverage operations as we moved from the payment terms under the co-manufacturing agreements to our own payment terms after integrating production. Turning now to our four business segments. Beverage alcohol net revenue was $56 million, up 132% from $24.2 million in the prior year. The positive delta was due to contributions from the craft brands which were purchased during Q2 of last year and new innovations across our brand portfolio. Through our expanding footprint, we now own and operate 20 brewpubs/restaurants in the U.S., that are in close proximity to the production of our craft brands. In the quarter these operations contributed $11 million of revenue, and we expect them to be a key part of our strategy going forward allowing us to increase brand visibility and gain an intimate understanding of our key consumers. Beverage alcohol gross profit increased to $22.9 million compared to $12.9 million and adjusted gross profit was $23.1 million compared to $13.5 million. While Beverage alcohol gross margin was 41% compared to 53%, and adjusted gross margin was 41% from 56% from the prior year quarter. Due to the seasonality of our Beverage business, our third quarter ended February 29, 2024 is our most comparable period, reflecting the newly acquired craft brands to which we improved adjusted gross margin by over 300 basis points as a result of our efforts in integrating and optimizing our facilities as well as a favorable product mix. As we mentioned at year-end, the new craft brands were initially subject to co-manufacturing agreements, inhibiting our ability to optimize production and control costs in a manner sufficient to increase our gross profit and margin. Effective May 31, all the co-manufacturing agreements except for production of Shock Top ended and the production of the brands were in-house, with Shock Top's production expected to be integrated into our production facilities in Q2. As we integrate production in-house, we are able to better optimize production utilization in our facilities, decreasing unabsorbed overheads as well as achieving purchase price synergies now that we are purchasing the raw ingredients. Gross cannabis revenue of $81.2 million was comprised of $57.2 million in Canadian adult-use revenue, $12.2 million in International cannabis revenue, $6.3 million in Canadian medical cannabis revenue and $5.5 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue, which includes $20 million in excise taxes was $61.2 million, representing a 13% decrease from the year-ago period. Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis grew 2%, despite the category being impacted by competition from the adult-use market, while revenue from Canadian adult-use decreased 20%, which was a result of our increased focus on preserving gross margin and maintaining a higher average selling price in categories that have experienced a high degree of price compression. International cannabis revenue decreased by 14%, which was largely driven by variability on the timing in countries other than Germany of receiving import and export permits, resulting in fluctuations on a quarterly basis. As Irwin said already, in the five months since legalization versus the five months before legalization, our Flower revenues in Germany are up 50%, and our extract sales are up 22%. As I mentioned, cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million, but down $9.1 million versus the prior year. As we focus on our goal of improving cannabis gross margins, we are intentionally less focused on share and revenue in certain categories, particularly those categories facing the most price compression, including infused, pre-roll, and vape. Despite the decline in net revenue and share in those categories, we increased cannabis gross profit by $4.4 million and increased adjusted cannabis gross margin by over 500 basis points from the prior year period. Cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million and cannabis gross margin was 40%. Adjusted cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior year quarter. The gross margin increase was driven by our International cannabis business, and in Canada, our continued focus on maintaining a higher average selling price and selling a favorable product mix to improve adjusted gross margins by 500 basis points. Distribution net revenue derived predominantly through Tilray Pharma was $68.1 million, compared to $69.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net revenue is attributed to the effects of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, revenue from distribution increased to $70.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of $69.2 million for the prior year period. Distribution gross profit increased to $7.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior year period. While distribution gross margin increased to 12% from 11% in the prior year quarter, because of product mix. Wellness net revenue grew 11% to $14.8 million from $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by our strategic focus on continued innovations and strong organic growth within our branded hemp business related to higher consumption. Wellness gross profit was $4.7 million, up from $3.8 million in the prior year quarter, and gross margin rose to 32% compared to 29%, a result of decreased input costs and continued operational efficiencies. Our cash and marketable securities balance as of October 31 was $280.1 million, up from $260.5 million at year-end. This change was a result of our temporary increase in working capital dependence, offset by the funds raised from our ATM. Since its initiation, we have raised $94.5 million on our ATM, which we intend to use for strategic and accretive acquisitions, including capital expenditures for acquired businesses. Let me now conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\\n\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can I ask a bit about the Canadian adult-use market and just how volumes are trending?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Blair is on the phone. I'll let him jump in a second. But I think the big thing which you see in Canada, how we've improved our margins there tremendously, and with Canada now being legal for five years, there's a lot of LPs that have come and gone and with us having 5 million square feet in Canada and being one of the largest and being the number one, there's a lot of volume, but the volume we're going to go after is profitable low volume and there's sales that we'll give up for. In the period, we introduced a lot of new products, a lot of new innovation. And what we've done with our facilities in regards to our yields, in regards to some of the products that we're doing today and the amount of pre-rolls, we sell over 80 million pre-rolls a year. We sell over 350 metric tons of flower a year. So volume is absolutely dependent, but it's profitable volume. Blair, you want to add anything to it?\\n\\nBlair MacNeil: Yes. Thanks, Irwin. And good question. In the industry overall, I would say, dollar volume is, as Irwin just talked about, compressed by some of the growth in those categories. But dollar volume is up 4.5% to 5% overall. If you look at the kgs shipped or the volume overall, the category is growing at 9% to 10%. So, we're still seeing healthy amounts of consumers come into the categories. We're seeing healthy amounts of growth in the business. I think what you're seeing is the offset of price compression. What we've made on choices that you heard in the results from Irwin and Carl is to not play as aggressively in those distillate and distillate-infused categories, which are margin challenged. So overall, I would say, the business is very healthy on the overall industry from a volume standpoint and a dollar volume standpoint still growing at about 5% on the dollar side. And then on the Tilray side, we're being very choiceful on how we balance our margin and our volume.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I think the big important thing is to realize is a couple of things. Number one, where you still pay a flat excise tax in Canada, you heard Carl say, we pay over $20 million in excise tax in the quarter. We pay close to $150 million for a full year. There's still definitely some price compression, but we're not going to play in areas where it's just all about price. And that's the big focus. The other thing is, our teams have done a great job of taking costs out and getting the yields on our grow, getting the yields on our products, and educating consumers. They're going to have to pay a little more for the quality products they're getting.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. Useful. And then maybe just update on where we are on price compression and maybe the balance of supply?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So let me just come back and say to this here. The interesting thing, as you go back and look over the last three years, we probably, in Canada, lost well over $200 million on price compression. And I'm not making excuses, that number drops to your bottom line. If you come back and look at ultimately excise tax being cut, and it was half, there's an extra $50 million, $70 million. So I think we're seeing price compression stabilize. In regards to inventories, with our growth today in our yields, and us ultimately balancing and right sizing our facilities, I think we're in a great state, a great place today in regards to what our inventories are. And the market continues to change dramatically in regards to potency. And that is a big thing today, it's amazing, and they're looking for 30% plus potencies today. And if you can grow it, you can sell it. And I think that's what's important, and we got caught a little on potencies on our good supply, and we saw some great growth in the quarter with regards to higher potencies in our good supply brand.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Great. Thanks, guys.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: And the last thing, just let me add there. It's five years now that cannabis is legal in Canada. Actually, it's five years what October 18 or something like that, coming up, the anniversary. The consumer now is educated, and we've had to build these brands from scratch. So these brands where brands that have been built from scratch, good supply is over a $200 plus million brand at retail, and educate -- the consumer there is educated today about quality, potency, genetics, and where the product comes from. And that's something Tilray has done an incredible job in making sure that we put great products out there. And listen, we still have a lot of restrictions in the packaging, how we advertise the products, how we communicate to our consumers.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. So, first, I just want to talk a high-level one in terms of how you're thinking about investing in the business and also driving profitable growth. You laid out a number of initiatives throughout the business. So I wanted to talk about how you're thinking about that. And then EBITDA growth throughout the year was down a bit in the first quarter. So how best to think about the levers and the cadence of EBITDA and what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, we come back, and this probably is one of our lowest quarters in the year. There's seasonality, which I don't think everybody looks at. There's also acquisitions, like in this quarter, there's nothing on the Molson Coors acquisition that we closed in early September. And in regards to rolling out new products, there's timing on that. In regards to our Delta-9 products in our beverage division, in regards to our non-alc, in regards to our Liquid Love, in regards to some of our other new products. So again, there is seasonality and there's timing on a lot of the new products in regards to the distribution of white space. The other big thing that's not in here is a lot of the costs that we're still taking out of this business with the integration of the ABI brands, a lot of costs still coming out in regards to our Canadian business. And in Europe, there's a lot happening there with Germany. Our flower business was up since the announcement of the new regulations in flower, Germany almost 50%. There's a time elapse of when we get products into the marketplace. There's a time elapse when products are shipped into the Poland market and some of the other ones. So a lot of it is just from a timing standpoint and the seasonality and our new products rolling out.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Okay, thanks, Irwin. That's helpful color. Second question for me, just on the Hemp-Derived THC beverages. You laid out a number of states in your prepared remarks. You had previously said two states. I just want to clarify, those states in your prepared remarks are those where you'll be distributing at brick-and-mortar or just DTC? And then secondly, just on Hemp-Derived beverages, how best to think about the ramping with brick-and-mortar and the impact of bills that have been introduced and the broader farm bill, which looks like it might be delayed another year, and how that's impacting broader distribution? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So in regards to Delta-9, it's basically going to be brick-and-mortar. We've already received our first orders and the majority of it will be rolled out into retailers and through our beer distributors that can sell it. Some will be definitely direct-to-consumer, but there's 19 states today that will allow this product. And we're pretty excited about the orders already and the demand for the product. And a lot more to come. We have five great products that we're going to roll out. So it will be basically sold direct -- it will basically be sold at retail these products, and through our beer distributors. Some will go through with our Happy Flower will be direct-to-consumer.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Good morning, everyone. Appreciate a lot of the commentary on sort of individual markets in Europe and how things are progressing on the regulatory front and even with respect to some demand. But I'm just curious, without getting into too specific, into the nitty-gritty of any numbers or anything, but if you look at your international contribution, both exports, boots on the ground, it's been run rating at close to about $50 million for a little while now. And I'm just wondering if any of these changes on the regulatory front are expected to have a meaningful impact on that contribution by the end of your fiscal year?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, I'll let Denise jump in here for a second, but I got to tell you, you've heard what I said in Germany, since the changes in regulations, our flower business was up almost 50%. And in regards to supply, and that's been some of our biggest constraints here some supply, we supply from our Canadian operations, we supply from our Portugal and some of the changes that we now have in Germany where we can sell out of our German facility where before we only could sell through the German government. So there's a lot of pieces in place, but listen, there's only 20 different countries that allow medical cannabis in Europe. And I think there is some tremendous opportunity to see the size of the category in billions. The demand is there. Denise, do you want to add to what I said?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Yes, sure. Thanks, Irwin. And I just do -- I do thank you for the question. I just want to challenge, like the one part about it running at $50 million for a few years now, because actually, I think if you look back over the progression, we actually have seen pretty significant growth year-over-year. If you look basically from the point of time of the Tilray acquisition up until our reported numbers from last year, and we're expecting very, very significant growth in this year's market. As we look to our -- by fiscal year '25, as Irwin mentioned, we had 50% growth in our flower business, 22% in our extract business, where we already have a sizable market share. We do have some, as Irwin mentioned in the previous question, we have some timing with import-export permits receiving in certain countries where we ship directly to a distributor versus our own warehouses, and therefore servicing markets through third-party distributors. So there will be some lumpiness. So it's really important to look at the business on a year -- on a year basis, not necessarily on a quarter basis, to get a full picture.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay, got it. Appreciate all that. And then I just wanted to sort of more of a general question, but just given some of the growth headwinds in the domestic Canadian market, obviously, there's been a lot of attention paid, and you guys have done a lot of good strategic initiatives, whether it's International or Beverage alcohol. But on the Wellness side of things, I'm just curious if there's any sort of M&A opportunities you think within there, or do you think this is more of a sort of organic growth story from the exposure you guys already have?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, in regards to Wellness, I think, listen, there's a lot of the medical in Canada that's coming over, and they're going into the -- you know, going into recreational and buying it there. But medical is something that we're focused on. We see tremendous use for the product, whether it's anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy. So there's a big medical opportunity for us. Is there acquisitions for us in that area? That is an area that we are focused on in regards to the medical part of the business. But I think the whole thing is, again, is our research that we're focused on medical, which is a big commitment for us. And being the number one medical producer in Europe, there's a lot we're learning there, and there's a lot as we work with universities and research that we're sharing back and forth, matter of fact, we're in Europe next week with our Canadian teams and our European teams working on multiple things there. So, yes, medical is a big part of our growth, and medical is something that's very, very important to us in the Canadian market.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay. Thanks all.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Good morning. I don't think I heard the fiscal '25 revenue guidance, which had been $950 million to $1 billion. Is that still the expectation for the year? And then, if I recall, that guidance had included some M&A, some expectation for some M&A, was the recent acquisition of the brands from Molson Coors, the M&A that was contemplated in that guidance, or is there still more implied?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So that was the guidance for the year. There is some M&A in there. We have not updated our guidance to include the Molson's acquisition.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Okay. And then on the International side, like I understand that it's up over a few years, it has been in that like, $11 million to $14 million on a per quarter basis for a little while, despite new positive developments. So, like what's offsetting the new positive developments in kind of on a more narrow timeframe?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: So thank you for the question. The international business, basically, if you remember, we used to actually, there's been some ins and outs, I think, in terms of the business. So it's not exactly on apples-to-apples. If you recall, a couple of years ago, Israel was actually a very big part of our revenue number. And if you might remember that it's been about a year and a half ago, two years ago, we discontinued our business in Israel. Just given the state of the market there, given the influx of products, the price compression, we just didn't feel that it was a profitable market for us to continue. So we discontinued those sales, which were quite sizable. However, in replacing that, we have sought out additional new countries. We entered Poland, we entered the U.K., Italy and Portugal. We've also identified a bunch of other countries which we will be entering. So stay tuned for that in future quarters. This business, as Irwin mentioned before, the Canadian business was just a few years old. The business in Europe is even more underdeveloped and immature at this point. And so, in essence, it really is just starting to grow and take off now. And so, I think it's still early innings for this business. We are very bullish about it going forward. And as Irwin mentioned, we look to invest -- we've already invested and we will continue to invest.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I just think, again, you got to come back, there's been some currency effect in Europe that affected us, as you look at it. But Denise mentioned, as we look at this from a profitability, Europe is very profitable for us. And I think that's what's very important is as we focus on profitability. The other thing is Germany being the biggest market there, and we were restricted with our facility in Germany that we only could sell to the German government at a loss. That has changed. So we were losing money in regards to a tender that was awarded five years ago, and we've been able to renegotiate that tender and renegotiate the terms of that. The second thing is, as each country legalizes, and we're not dealing with states here, we're dealing with different countries with different regulatory. So building out the European market absolutely has been difficult. And there's markets that we've abandoned. We are not selling into the Israeli market, which used to be one of the biggest markets for us. So, what I can reassure you is, there's tremendous opportunities of growth. We only really sell flower and tinctures. It's not like we're selling pre-rolls and we're selling multiple different products here. We're selling over 100 different products, but it's basically flower and tinctures, and that's it. So we look for Europe to be a big opportunity. We are the largest grower of cannabis in Europe today. We have the infrastructure on the ground, taking a little time, but what's important to us is the profitability there. The other thing is we're vertically integrated with our CC Pharma, CC -- our Tilray Pharma there in regards to distributing through the drugstores. So, yes, you know, it's not growing as fast, but it is a very profitable business for us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the Delta-9 beverages. It's been tough in the cannabis space at least, really, building brands that kind of parallel to how they've developed in other categories. And so this is an interesting case to see how it plays out. But I guess with that in mind, you have four brands, I think you mentioned, you've got teed up and more to come. Why so many? And how do you plan to develop those and set them up for sustainable growth?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, the brands are developed, and again we've had Happy Flower out there for a long time with CBD 420 is one of our brands that are known. Two or three of our other brands have some uniqueness to them. So, again, with our five different products out there, it gives us differentiation in products, it allows us to have multiple products out there. And so far, everything we have shown retailers, distributors, they've liked, and we got quite a few orders. So, yes, 420 is a brand that's well-known out there. Happy Flower has been out there. We have to build some of our other brands out there, and we've done that before, as we've come out with new products in regards to Runner's High, which is our non-alc beer and our Montauk non-alc beer, our Liquid Love is our water brand that's coming out there. Our Delta-9, our new brand. Listen, the big thing is out there. We got products. We've developed these flavors. We developed these products from scratch. We got 700 distributors out there, and these distributors want it now, we only can sell it in the states that is legal. And we got field salespeople out there on the street that will make sure we get this product in the hands. The last but not least, which is important, how do we market that to the consumer? And that's what's important for us to make sure we're getting the message across to the consumer. There's some really good products that we're coming up with.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Yes, no, so that's helpful. And then just on some of the -- you touched on some of the integration of beer production and how you've got more flexibility now. How significant can that be and how quickly could it come in terms of just, would we be right to think that you could consolidate some facilities or how do we just think about what to expect in the next several quarters for how that impacts your numbers?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, no, good question there. Listen, we're in a category today where the craft beer industry is declining 3%, but there's $100 billion worth of beer sold out there. So it's not like a small category. So there is tremendous opportunities in the craft beer business, okay? And with that, we think we can go out there and take share with innovation, with some of the new products that we've launched. We think we come back and look at whether it's the non-alc industry that's growing tremendously within Delta-9. The other thing is, we're going back to each of our brands today. We have 19 brands out there, and we're looking at these brands where they should be sold regionally and what should be a national brand. Shock Top definitely should be a national brand. But if you take Montauk, you take Blue Point and take SweetWater, and you focus them sort of in the Northeast, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, maybe Florida, that's over 100 million people that we can market our brands to. We don't need to be in every single state out there and ship 10,000, 20,000 cases there, spend money on it where we're not going to get the lift. If you come back and look at SweetWater, SweetWater grew a 2.5 million, 3 million case brand. But it went into certain states, whether it's Ohio or Illinois, it didn't make sense in those states, California. So what we're going to do is take these brands, focus on three, four, five states, put our money behind them, work with the distributors, educate the consumers about them, and then take our national brands like a Shock Top. And the other thing, what we're going to look at this here, if we have a pumpkin beer, we'll have pumpkin beer in similar flavors for Montauk, for Blue Point. We're not going to have all these multiple different formulas out there with a lot of complexity. So we're looking at how we take our tail of our brands. We're looking at how to take complexity out of our business. We're going to do some SKU rationalization. And with this, it will optimize and right-size our footprint and the buying power today with over 15 million cases of beer that we're buying. And if we have to consolidate some of our facilities, which we're right now looking at, we ultimately will, but we really feel, you know, within a matter since 2020, we're now the fifth largest craft brewer out there with a 5% share out there. And we think we can get this category growing again through our innovation, through our distribution. And I got to tell you, working with distributors out there, they all want to see growth, they all want to see new innovation, they want to see products. And the same with the retailers. The retailers are looking at there's way too many brands, way too many products, how do we ultimately get this category growing, because it takes up too much space in stores.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Irwin, maybe can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about U.S. plan touching assets? We've seen other companies that set up ring fence structures, Canopy USA, SNDL with SunStream, OGI has talked about that also. I mean, there's been more consolidation, and we would come to a point that there won't be much left to buy. So how do you handicap that? And how do you think about, you know, doing something similar in the current context of regulation?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So I step back, and listen, the good news is the two presidential candidates are in favor of legalization. And I think in regards to rescheduling, there's, in December, the recommendations are going to come up on that. So, Pablo, I think something will happen in regards to rescheduling, and something will happen in regards to Federal legalization, whether it's medical cannabis that will be legalized and ultimately leave it up to the states for everything else. If you come back and look at what we can do, remember, we've gone in once Canada was legalized five years ago, they tell me it's six years ago, but I think it's still five, it was 2018, so I guess that is six years ago. If you come back and look at it, we built our Canadian business to a $300-plus million business from scratch. And we built it -- we built grow facilities, we built brands, we built vertical integration. And today, as being one of the largest growers up there with almost 5 million square feet, we know how to grow cannabis. We know we have the genetic base. We know how to -- you know, make pre-rolls, we know how to make tinctures, we know how to make drinks. We'll sell this year close to 9 million cans of cannabis-infused drinks. So we have, you know, the DNA, we have the know-how. You know we're one of the largest medical cannabis companies in Canada and in Europe. So with that, we're ready to do it on our own in the U.S., depending upon what the guidelines and the parameters are. And on the other hand, with our balance sheet, where it is today, we have the ability to go out and acquire a great strategic partner that can help us, but that makes sense. The other thing in the U.S. today, we have 18 beer brands or 19 beer brands. We have multiple brands in our spirits business, and we have our wellness brand in Manitoba Harvest. Can these brands parlay over into the cannabis category like we're doing with some of these in Delta-9? So again, I think, with cannabis going to legalize, and that's my opinion, I have nothing else, you know, any other insight, we will be ready to jump into which way we can jump in there and be ready for it.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. And one last one, maybe for Denise, just going back to the discussion in Germany, maybe using some Michael Porter's terms here, but maybe remind us of your competitive advantage there, your competitive assets, your asset strengths. What are the barriers to entry? Because what I hear, there's all these licensed importers that are able to bring products, we saw a big jump apparently in imports in the second and third quarter, and then they are able to go to doctors, promote those products, and sell them to the consumers, right? So I don't know if I want to see more fragmentation as opposed to consolidation in Germany. But I'm sure you have assets on the ground that give you an advantage. But I'm just trying to understand how the German market plays out in terms of fragmentation versus consolidation. Just importers versus local producers. And what's your edge? And why should we assume that you are better positioned than others? If you can just mention that. And as part of that, a quick reminder, if you produce, if you jump production in Germany by five times, I suppose that replaces Portugal or Canada, does that mean that you end up with a higher cost structure? Thank you.\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Thanks, Pablo, and thank you for the question. I think, also I just want to also bring back to the previous question that was asked, because I think it -- I was remiss in not stating the fact that if you look at our year-over-year growth between FY24 and FY23 in terms of the European market, we grew that market 34%. So I just wanted to actually finish off that last question, which I didn't do the last time. In terms of Germany, I think you are 100% right in terms of our uniquely positioned in Germany and in Europe, in particular. We mentioned Aphria RX facility with our ability under our new -- our newly issued license, we have the ability to produce to full capacity, which basically allows us to produce five times what we were able to produce under the tender. In addition, we expanded that license, under the tender we were permitted to produce three strains. Today, we now are able to do 31 cultivars, and I'm proud to say that actually what just landed at Neumunster is a bunch of cultivars from our Canadian facilities, where we look at those cultivars that perform best in market in Canada. And we've shipped those cultivars over to both Portugal and Aphria RX in order to provide ourselves with the maximum flexibility both in supply chain, as well as the availability of products to patients. Having that facility, as well as our Portugal facility, as well as we've opened up the ability to deliver product from Canada, we have the -- probably what I would -- what I would classify as the most flexible supply chain of any cannabis company in Europe where we see many of -- and you mentioned about whether there's segmentation and consolidation, and as you know, there is a few larger players in the Canadian -- in the German market, but there's, and then there's a proliferation of a lot of smaller, smaller companies that are -- that are coming online and starting and continue in German market. I do think at some point there will be consolidation, just because if you have a lot of players in a market, you will start to see consolidation of those players. But going back to our unique position, we have the most flexible supply chain, we have a great cost structure. Given the work that we've done in order to make sure that we always keep our cost to produce very low and we're very efficient. In addition, we have a terrific first-class commercial team located in Europe and with boots on the ground in Germany. We have a sales team that is very well positioned in terms of their knowledge, their reputation with doctors, their reputation with government officials, and the fact of the matter of being one of the first in Germany has given us a reputation of being trusted and having the expertise. So as doctors want to learn more and more about medical cannabis in light of the new regulations, we are one of the first that they seek out in order to get that information because they want to know how to prescribe and they want to know how to continue in the market.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the quarterly results in beverage. I didn't hear whether you said that those -- the sales were in line or a little below expectations. I think you said cannabis was in line or better. So can you just tell us like, just how did beverage do versus you thought? The tracking data shows the brands are down a bit. Do they just need like -- is it a matter of timing before your new marketing efforts and your consolidation efforts take hold before the retail sales get a little bit better?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, Robert, thank you. We don't give guidance out there by the major businesses, but we have definitely internal guidance and internal budgets. The beverage business was off a bit and a lot of that is just timing on some of the new products and a lot of it is the products are ready, it's when the distributors ultimately take them, and that was the biggest thing. The other thing which you heard me talk about earlier is right-sizing the business here and going through our SKU rationalization, going through our brand rationalization, and going through our distribution white space. Also there is timing in regards to customers taking new products in, products for Halloween, products -- our pumping products, and some of the different things like that. So just a timing standpoint. But the other one was integration of some of the ABI brands back into our facilities and supplies. So it's just from a timing standpoint, it's a timing standpoint. If you look at our quarterly -- if you look at our numbers here, our SG&A was way up in regards to our beverage business. But as we build out the infrastructure and build out people and take over the ABI business and do some of the spending, we expect to get the benefits from that over the year. So with that, we are excited to what we see that's happening out there. We think we're well positioned with our brands, with our products, with our innovation. Our customers are giving us good feedback. We have a lot of high hopes for Delta-9, we have a lot of high hopes for our non-alc, we have a lot of hopes for our Liquid Love. We'll have a lot of hopes for some of the new innovation that's coming out under SweetWater, Montauk, and 10 Barrel, and which, again, which is not really in our numbers, with the acquisition that we just acquired, the four brands from Molson Coors, and getting our hands around them and seeing the growth opportunities with that. So with that, it's just early timing in regards to our beverage business, but there is a real, real, real good plan in place there, Robert.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Simon for any final comments.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you very much, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud and excited of what we've been able to put together over the last five-plus years. As you heard our guidance out there is $950 million to $1 billion of size, and that's coming from a startup basically at $50 million. Today, we have over 44 brands. We have 2,700 people that work within this company today. We have plenty facilities, we sell in over 20 countries, six different continents. And again, we are dealing in categories where regulation is important. There is no one company out there that does what we do as diversified as us. So it's not easy. And there's a lot of noise and a lot of news every day coming up about cannabis. As we sit here and wait, there's a lot of changes that got to happen. But again, the cannabis industry in the U.S. is over $40-plus billion in total size. So there's a big, big, big market out there. You look at the total beer industry out there and the size just of the craft industry, there's a big business out there. You look at the wellness industry and some of the stuff that we're doing with hemp and that grew about 11% in the quarter. So we're well positioned. If you come back and look at our balance sheet, and that's something I think that's hurt a lot of other companies out there in the cannabis industry, is we really have managed our balance sheet, managed our cash situation, managed paying down debt. In our last quarter, we paid down over $300 million of our convertible debt. So we're focused on this and pulling all this together. Are we totally happy with our stock performance? No. But I don't think it reflects of what this company has done over the last five years and how we put together some great brands, great people, a great strategy, and how we're diversified out there. And we're a global company in the CPG industry. So, I feel there's exciting times ahead. You have great brands, you have a really committed team. We have a tight, tight strategy out there. We have great partners with our distributors, our retailers, our consumers, who we're marketing to. And last but not least, our aim is to please our shareholders and reward our shareholders. With that, thank you very much and enjoy your day. Go Mets, go Yankees. And you go to Citi Field, you'll find our beer. You go to San Diego, you'll find our beers. So we want stadiums that are in the playoffs that are selling our beers. So with that, be safe out there, and thank you for joining us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\",\n",

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands Chairman and CEO, Irwin Simon.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you, Berrin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the last five years, Tilray Brands has evolved into a new company. We no longer are just a Canadian cannabis LP. Tilray Brands has grown tremendously, and we're setting a new precedent for the CPG industry. Not only have we set the stage for a new era of consumer habits, Tilray Brands has pushed forward, disrupting the global CPG industry and revolutionizing consumer products. Tilray is at the forefront of innovation, pioneering and leading the convergence of beverages, cannabis, hemp, wellness, and distribution industries on a global scale. Our operations span over 20 countries and five continents with 44 consumer-connected lifestyle brands and 20 vertically integrated facilities that produce approximately 90% of our products in-house, ensuring the highest quality of our products. Tilray continues to lead with the number one cannabis business in Canada, leading medical cannabis business across Europe, the number one branded hemp business in North America, and the fifth-largest craft beer business in the U.S. Our success in building a new era of consumer products that resonates with today's discerning consumers and caters to their ever-evolving consumption habits and transforming the way consumers eat, drink and unwind with cannabis, hemp, and beverage products is a testament to our commitment on delivering innovative products that meets the needs of the modern consumer and drive growth across industries. Moving on to Q1, we achieved our record first-quarter net revenue results, while strengthening our operations, increasing gross margin, and increasing our gross profit. We hit net revenue of $200 million, representing a 13% growth year-over-year. Our gross profit increased by 35% and gross margin increased by over 500 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Our beverage business, including craft beer, spirits, and our new non-alc beers and other non-alcoholic drinks grew 132% in net revenue year-over-year. We strengthened our leadership position as the fifth-largest U.S. craft beer brewer with a 5% market share as a result of our craft acquisition from ABI. We recently launched a new beverage division called Tilray Alternative Beverages, focused on fueling key markets across the U.S., with innovative federally legal, hemp derivative Delta 9, THC branded, and branded products. This is an exciting new segment for us, and our network of distributors, which I'll get into in more detail shortly. We focused our cannabis business on strengthening our operations and increasing our margins, leading to a gross profit increasing by 22%. We continue to lead the branded hemp food industry with a 52% branded market share, with Manitoba Harvest in the U.S. and the Canadian market share of nearly 80%. And our financial foundation remains strong with a robust balance sheet, ample cash reserves, reduced debt levels and flexibility to explore potential new acquisitions. Our financial strength enables us to pursue new opportunities and capitalize on emerging trends in the market. Let's now dive deeper into each of our business segments. Starting with Tilray Beverages. Today, our Beverage division leads with 19 iconic brands, ten network manufacturing facilities and over 700 distributors, 20 brewpubs and restaurants, and leading sales and marketing teams across the U.S. Our beverage strategy is focused on growing our portfolio brands in selected states, regional markets and ensuring product excellence and innovation, driving focused scale, expanding targeted distribution to increase our market penetration and consumer access. In our Beverage segment we generated $56 million of net revenue in Q1. Across our growing craft brands, SweetWater is the number one volume brand family in Georgia, multi-outlet and convenience stores. Montauk is the number one branded family in New York Metro, having increased at a rate of sale of 240 basis points year-over-year. And Tilray is the number one craft supplier in the Pacific Northwest, thanks in part to the continued success of 10 Barrel's Pub Beer, Shock Top remains a leading priority as we relaunch the brand's number one seasonal offering, Shock Top Pretzel. During Q1 and Q2, driving additional 5,000 distribution points in the last 45 days. The Pacific Northwest grew overall Shock Top distribution by 42% during the Q1, adding 1,100 new placements for the brand. In the Northeast, Montauk's flagship Wave Chaser IPA continues to post positive year-over-year volume distribution gains adding a net of 139 off-premise accounts during Q1. Three of SweetWater's top 12-pack SKUs, 420 Pale Ale, OG IPA and the Hazy IPA all posted positive trends for Q1 trending a plus 7%, a plus 24% and a plus 17%, respectively. As we've mentioned before, our ambition is far beyond our current reach, as we continue our focus to become a dominant leading beverage business by leveraging and are strengthening our portfolio of beloved local craft brands, recruiting new customers, and activating more occasions, driving new growth across these brands. Additionally, we are innovating across adjacent categories, including flavored malt beverages, ready-to-drink cocktails, spirits, and also beyond alcohol, we will grow our non-alc beer category and expand further into water, energy and other categories. Our powerful college sports partnerships across the country will be leveraged to bring new LDA consumers and fans into different brand families, especially Shock Top. Separately, our MLS music events and local community partnerships allow our brands to recruit and retain our core customers across different age groups. We have the manufacturing facilities, the distribution, the sales and marketing infrastructure to drive tremendous growth in the Tilray Beverages business. In the non-alcoholic segment, Montauk non-alc craft beer is now sold in 650 counts and new brand, Runner's High Brewing Company has launched in the Southeast with three brews; Runner's High Golden Wheat, Raspberry Wheat, and Dark Chocolate, with several expansion markets to follow. With over 700 beer distributors, Tilray is now a leading supplier in key regions across the U.S., with regional jewels in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, and the Southeast. With each beverage acquisition we've made over the past few years, SweetWater, Green Flash, Alpine, Montauk Brewing, the craft acquisitions from ABI and most recently, the acquisitions of our four brands in Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). We are laser-focused on operational efficiency, optimizing cost structure, and getting the margins of the acquired brands up above 40%, like SweetWater and our other legacy businesses, we've identified additional growth opportunities in our beverage business. Tilray Beverage is going after category diversification and we've identified four categories. We expect to generate $30 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025. These four categories include: light lagers, $117 million category; flavored malt beverages, a $4.7 billion category; sparkling water, a $12 billion category; and the non-alc brew, a $445 million category. With our recent launch of Tilray Alternative Beverages, we are focused on fueling the U.S. with Hemp-Derived Delta-9 beverages, which is an estimated $2.8 billion market in the U.S. We're beginning to launch our Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC brands and products in key states including Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee with distribution driven by our existing and robust beer distribution network. Our initial portfolio of HDD9 brands include Happy Flower, Herb & Bloom, [420 Hops], Fizzy Jane and we expect to launch additional brands by the end of this calendar year. Happy Flower is currently available online through Drink Happy Flower. The growth of Hemp-Derived Delta-9 THC drink business in the U.S. is remarkable. And we are excited to see its potential for our beer distribution network who are eager to jump into the business and already have begun placing orders. We look forward to sharing more updates on this development soon. Turning to Tilray Cannabis. In Canada, Tilray continues to lead the Canadian market share by almost 170 bps over the next competitor and have been consistently at the top of the industry for the past three years. From a regional perspective, Tilray is number one across British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. These provinces combined include over 86% of the Canadian population. We've also led in all other markets combined. In adult-use recreational cannabis, we focus on margin improvement across our portfolio brands and products resulting in improved adjusted gross margin by 500 basis points in Q1 versus last year. The margin improvement, partnered with efficient utilization, production, and further cost savings initiatives will allow us to grow our revenue, profitability, sustainability well into the future. In Q1 20% of our net sales revenue came from new innovation. Our mainstream Flower business continued to grow, because of our strong genetics. Our Redecan brand moved up to the number six position brand in Canada as reported by Hifyre data. In Beverages, Tilray continues to dominate the beverage category with a 45% market share, and at the end of August, with XMG, Mollo, THC beverage brands being the number one and number two brands, respectively. Tilray shipped 78 metric tons of biomass, or approximately 25% of the implied Canadian market volume in Q1. We continue to leverage the wholesale channel where contribution margins are better and supply is starting to balance. On an adult-rec we shipped 16 million pre-rolled cones and over 2.1 million cans of beverages in Q1. Turning to our International business in Q1, we continue to execute against our three basic initiatives. First, the acceleration of growth in Germany. In Germany, since the Cannabis Act went into effect on April 1, 2024, we've seen a 50% increase in medical flower sales, as well as a 22% increase in medical cannabis extracts, where we already have a dominant share of the market, and we believe that our current positioning in Germany provides us with several unique competitive advantages to capture a significant share of the expected medical cannabis market, which is projected to be approximately $3 billion in the medium term. We expect to continue our growth in this very important market through commercial excellence and increased supply. We will continue to leverage the expertise and relationship of our CC Pharma / Tilray Pharma distribution business in Germany, which supports our medical cannabis business through its network of 13,000 pharmacy and wholesalers. Second, the bifurcation and differentiation of physician-led and patient-led channels. As a market leader in the physician-led channel, we're turning our focus to accelerating our growth in the patient-led channel. One of our major initiatives in this regard is improving the availability and the quality of our medical cannabis supply to meet needs of patients-led channels by creating a flexible and diversified supply chain focused on high-quality flower and new innovation. At Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Rx, our German cultivation and processing facility, we received the very first commercial cannabis cultivation license and commercial distribution license issued in Germany under the new regulations. These new license granted Tilray the ability to cultivate, produce, and distribute premium quality medical cannabis, with the ability to increase our production by approximately 5 times. Aphria RX can now fully utilize and maximize its growing capacity while also expanding its genetics to a total of 31 approved strains from the previously approved three strains. We've already completed our first harvest under new cultivation license. We expect to commercialize these products in Q2. We've also begun to supply our international markets with EU GMP-certified medical cannabis products from our Canadian facilities. With medical cannabis from Aphria Diamond launching in Poland and Broken Coast and Redecan launching in Australia. We expect to launch additional cultivation from Broken Coast and Aphria Diamond in the coming months. And finally, we'll continue to identify and enter new markets with the potential to generate material revenue and profit opportunities. We expect European opportunities could represent a potential $45 billion medical market over the long term. And with our presence in Europe, it allows Tilray to grow our global brand portfolio to a base of over 700 million people in Europe, which is twice the population in the U.S. Finally, let's discuss our Tilray Wellness business, focused on improving people's lives through the power of hemp. Tilray Wellness is represented mainly by Manitoba Harvest, our leading hemp brand with over a 53% market share in branded hemp products. Wellness is also comprised of Happy Flower beverages and HiBall energy drinks. In Q1, Tilray Wellness delivered 11% net revenue growth compared to the prior year, driven by strong core business sales coupled with hemp innovation and the expansion into wellness beverages. A strong focus on cost helped the business improve margins, delivering a 300 basis point increase in gross margin to 32%. As Tilray Brands has transformed, expanded and completed numerous acquisitions to get where we are today, our mission has evolved to be a leading premium lifestyle company with a house of brands and innovation of products that inspire joy, wellness, and create memorable experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carl to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Carl?\\n\\nCarl Merton: Thank you, Irwin. As a reminder, our financial results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. Let's now review our quarterly performance for the three months ended August 31, 2024. In Q1 net revenue was $200 million, a 13% growth rate compared to the previous year quarter net revenue of $177 million. As Irwin stated, our Q1 net revenue was a record amount. In constant currency, net revenue grew to $204 million. By segment, beverage alcohol net revenue increased 132% to $56 million. Cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million as a result of our strong focus on margins and strategic growth in key markets, which I will discuss in a moment. Distribution net revenue was flat and wellness net revenue rose 11% in the quarter. From a segment perspective, 28% of our net revenue was generated by our beverage alcohol business, 31% was generated by our cannabis business, 34% by our distribution business, and 7% by our wellness business. This compares to 13% in beverage alcohol, 40% in cannabis, 39% in distribution, and 8% in wellness in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance is due to our craft beverage acquisition, which occurred in Q2 of last year. Gross profit increased by 35% to $59.7 million compared to $44.2 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased to 30%, and over 500 basis point increase from the prior year period. Adjusted gross profit increased 21% to $59.9 million from $49.3 million in the prior year, while adjusted gross margin increased by 200 basis points to 30%, primarily reflecting our focus on improving our utilizations at our beverage alcohol facilities and favorable sales mix. Net loss improved by 38% to $34.7 million compared to a net loss of $55.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a per share basis, this amounted to a net loss of $0.04 per share, which was a 60% improvement compared to a net loss of $0.10 per share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss was $6.1 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $27.1 million in the prior year quarter, a 78% improvement year-over-year with adjusted net loss per share coming in at negative $0.01 per share, a significant beat compared to expectations of negative $0.05. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million compared to $10.7 million in the prior year quarter. We are now approaching six consecutive years of generating positive adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA from the prior year quarter is primarily related to building infrastructure and an increased investment in marketing and promotions at Tilray Beverages. Cash flow used in operations was $35.3 million compared to $15.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was negative $39.5 million compared to negative $6.3 million in the prior year quarter as a result of an increased demand on our working capital in our beverage operations as we moved from the payment terms under the co-manufacturing agreements to our own payment terms after integrating production. Turning now to our four business segments. Beverage alcohol net revenue was $56 million, up 132% from $24.2 million in the prior year. The positive delta was due to contributions from the craft brands which were purchased during Q2 of last year and new innovations across our brand portfolio. Through our expanding footprint, we now own and operate 20 brewpubs/restaurants in the U.S., that are in close proximity to the production of our craft brands. In the quarter these operations contributed $11 million of revenue, and we expect them to be a key part of our strategy going forward allowing us to increase brand visibility and gain an intimate understanding of our key consumers. Beverage alcohol gross profit increased to $22.9 million compared to $12.9 million and adjusted gross profit was $23.1 million compared to $13.5 million. While Beverage alcohol gross margin was 41% compared to 53%, and adjusted gross margin was 41% from 56% from the prior year quarter. Due to the seasonality of our Beverage business, our third quarter ended February 29, 2024 is our most comparable period, reflecting the newly acquired craft brands to which we improved adjusted gross margin by over 300 basis points as a result of our efforts in integrating and optimizing our facilities as well as a favorable product mix. As we mentioned at year-end, the new craft brands were initially subject to co-manufacturing agreements, inhibiting our ability to optimize production and control costs in a manner sufficient to increase our gross profit and margin. Effective May 31, all the co-manufacturing agreements except for production of Shock Top ended and the production of the brands were in-house, with Shock Top's production expected to be integrated into our production facilities in Q2. As we integrate production in-house, we are able to better optimize production utilization in our facilities, decreasing unabsorbed overheads as well as achieving purchase price synergies now that we are purchasing the raw ingredients. Gross cannabis revenue of $81.2 million was comprised of $57.2 million in Canadian adult-use revenue, $12.2 million in International cannabis revenue, $6.3 million in Canadian medical cannabis revenue and $5.5 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue, which includes $20 million in excise taxes was $61.2 million, representing a 13% decrease from the year-ago period. Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis grew 2%, despite the category being impacted by competition from the adult-use market, while revenue from Canadian adult-use decreased 20%, which was a result of our increased focus on preserving gross margin and maintaining a higher average selling price in categories that have experienced a high degree of price compression. International cannabis revenue decreased by 14%, which was largely driven by variability on the timing in countries other than Germany of receiving import and export permits, resulting in fluctuations on a quarterly basis. As Irwin said already, in the five months since legalization versus the five months before legalization, our Flower revenues in Germany are up 50%, and our extract sales are up 22%. As I mentioned, cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million, but down $9.1 million versus the prior year. As we focus on our goal of improving cannabis gross margins, we are intentionally less focused on share and revenue in certain categories, particularly those categories facing the most price compression, including infused, pre-roll, and vape. Despite the decline in net revenue and share in those categories, we increased cannabis gross profit by $4.4 million and increased adjusted cannabis gross margin by over 500 basis points from the prior year period. Cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million and cannabis gross margin was 40%. Adjusted cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior year quarter. The gross margin increase was driven by our International cannabis business, and in Canada, our continued focus on maintaining a higher average selling price and selling a favorable product mix to improve adjusted gross margins by 500 basis points. Distribution net revenue derived predominantly through Tilray Pharma was $68.1 million, compared to $69.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net revenue is attributed to the effects of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, revenue from distribution increased to $70.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of $69.2 million for the prior year period. Distribution gross profit increased to $7.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior year period. While distribution gross margin increased to 12% from 11% in the prior year quarter, because of product mix. Wellness net revenue grew 11% to $14.8 million from $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by our strategic focus on continued innovations and strong organic growth within our branded hemp business related to higher consumption. Wellness gross profit was $4.7 million, up from $3.8 million in the prior year quarter, and gross margin rose to 32% compared to 29%, a result of decreased input costs and continued operational efficiencies. Our cash and marketable securities balance as of October 31 was $280.1 million, up from $260.5 million at year-end. This change was a result of our temporary increase in working capital dependence, offset by the funds raised from our ATM. Since its initiation, we have raised $94.5 million on our ATM, which we intend to use for strategic and accretive acquisitions, including capital expenditures for acquired businesses. Let me now conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\\n\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can I ask a bit about the Canadian adult-use market and just how volumes are trending?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Blair is on the phone. I'll let him jump in a second. But I think the big thing which you see in Canada, how we've improved our margins there tremendously, and with Canada now being legal for five years, there's a lot of LPs that have come and gone and with us having 5 million square feet in Canada and being one of the largest and being the number one, there's a lot of volume, but the volume we're going to go after is profitable low volume and there's sales that we'll give up for. In the period, we introduced a lot of new products, a lot of new innovation. And what we've done with our facilities in regards to our yields, in regards to some of the products that we're doing today and the amount of pre-rolls, we sell over 80 million pre-rolls a year. We sell over 350 metric tons of flower a year. So volume is absolutely dependent, but it's profitable volume. Blair, you want to add anything to it?\\n\\nBlair MacNeil: Yes. Thanks, Irwin. And good question. In the industry overall, I would say, dollar volume is, as Irwin just talked about, compressed by some of the growth in those categories. But dollar volume is up 4.5% to 5% overall. If you look at the kgs shipped or the volume overall, the category is growing at 9% to 10%. So, we're still seeing healthy amounts of consumers come into the categories. We're seeing healthy amounts of growth in the business. I think what you're seeing is the offset of price compression. What we've made on choices that you heard in the results from Irwin and Carl is to not play as aggressively in those distillate and distillate-infused categories, which are margin challenged. So overall, I would say, the business is very healthy on the overall industry from a volume standpoint and a dollar volume standpoint still growing at about 5% on the dollar side. And then on the Tilray side, we're being very choiceful on how we balance our margin and our volume.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I think the big important thing is to realize is a couple of things. Number one, where you still pay a flat excise tax in Canada, you heard Carl say, we pay over $20 million in excise tax in the quarter. We pay close to $150 million for a full year. There's still definitely some price compression, but we're not going to play in areas where it's just all about price. And that's the big focus. The other thing is, our teams have done a great job of taking costs out and getting the yields on our grow, getting the yields on our products, and educating consumers. They're going to have to pay a little more for the quality products they're getting.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. Useful. And then maybe just update on where we are on price compression and maybe the balance of supply?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So let me just come back and say to this here. The interesting thing, as you go back and look over the last three years, we probably, in Canada, lost well over $200 million on price compression. And I'm not making excuses, that number drops to your bottom line. If you come back and look at ultimately excise tax being cut, and it was half, there's an extra $50 million, $70 million. So I think we're seeing price compression stabilize. In regards to inventories, with our growth today in our yields, and us ultimately balancing and right sizing our facilities, I think we're in a great state, a great place today in regards to what our inventories are. And the market continues to change dramatically in regards to potency. And that is a big thing today, it's amazing, and they're looking for 30% plus potencies today. And if you can grow it, you can sell it. And I think that's what's important, and we got caught a little on potencies on our good supply, and we saw some great growth in the quarter with regards to higher potencies in our good supply brand.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala: Great. Thanks, guys.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: And the last thing, just let me add there. It's five years now that cannabis is legal in Canada. Actually, it's five years what October 18 or something like that, coming up, the anniversary. The consumer now is educated, and we've had to build these brands from scratch. So these brands where brands that have been built from scratch, good supply is over a $200 plus million brand at retail, and educate -- the consumer there is educated today about quality, potency, genetics, and where the product comes from. And that's something Tilray has done an incredible job in making sure that we put great products out there. And listen, we still have a lot of restrictions in the packaging, how we advertise the products, how we communicate to our consumers.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. So, first, I just want to talk a high-level one in terms of how you're thinking about investing in the business and also driving profitable growth. You laid out a number of initiatives throughout the business. So I wanted to talk about how you're thinking about that. And then EBITDA growth throughout the year was down a bit in the first quarter. So how best to think about the levers and the cadence of EBITDA and what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, we come back, and this probably is one of our lowest quarters in the year. There's seasonality, which I don't think everybody looks at. There's also acquisitions, like in this quarter, there's nothing on the Molson Coors acquisition that we closed in early September. And in regards to rolling out new products, there's timing on that. In regards to our Delta-9 products in our beverage division, in regards to our non-alc, in regards to our Liquid Love, in regards to some of our other new products. So again, there is seasonality and there's timing on a lot of the new products in regards to the distribution of white space. The other big thing that's not in here is a lot of the costs that we're still taking out of this business with the integration of the ABI brands, a lot of costs still coming out in regards to our Canadian business. And in Europe, there's a lot happening there with Germany. Our flower business was up since the announcement of the new regulations in flower, Germany almost 50%. There's a time elapse of when we get products into the marketplace. There's a time elapse when products are shipped into the Poland market and some of the other ones. So a lot of it is just from a timing standpoint and the seasonality and our new products rolling out.\\n\\nAaron Grey: Okay, thanks, Irwin. That's helpful color. Second question for me, just on the Hemp-Derived THC beverages. You laid out a number of states in your prepared remarks. You had previously said two states. I just want to clarify, those states in your prepared remarks are those where you'll be distributing at brick-and-mortar or just DTC? And then secondly, just on Hemp-Derived beverages, how best to think about the ramping with brick-and-mortar and the impact of bills that have been introduced and the broader farm bill, which looks like it might be delayed another year, and how that's impacting broader distribution? Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So in regards to Delta-9, it's basically going to be brick-and-mortar. We've already received our first orders and the majority of it will be rolled out into retailers and through our beer distributors that can sell it. Some will be definitely direct-to-consumer, but there's 19 states today that will allow this product. And we're pretty excited about the orders already and the demand for the product. And a lot more to come. We have five great products that we're going to roll out. So it will be basically sold direct -- it will basically be sold at retail these products, and through our beer distributors. Some will go through with our Happy Flower will be direct-to-consumer.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Good morning, everyone. Appreciate a lot of the commentary on sort of individual markets in Europe and how things are progressing on the regulatory front and even with respect to some demand. But I'm just curious, without getting into too specific, into the nitty-gritty of any numbers or anything, but if you look at your international contribution, both exports, boots on the ground, it's been run rating at close to about $50 million for a little while now. And I'm just wondering if any of these changes on the regulatory front are expected to have a meaningful impact on that contribution by the end of your fiscal year?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, I'll let Denise jump in here for a second, but I got to tell you, you've heard what I said in Germany, since the changes in regulations, our flower business was up almost 50%. And in regards to supply, and that's been some of our biggest constraints here some supply, we supply from our Canadian operations, we supply from our Portugal and some of the changes that we now have in Germany where we can sell out of our German facility where before we only could sell through the German government. So there's a lot of pieces in place, but listen, there's only 20 different countries that allow medical cannabis in Europe. And I think there is some tremendous opportunity to see the size of the category in billions. The demand is there. Denise, do you want to add to what I said?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Yes, sure. Thanks, Irwin. And I just do -- I do thank you for the question. I just want to challenge, like the one part about it running at $50 million for a few years now, because actually, I think if you look back over the progression, we actually have seen pretty significant growth year-over-year. If you look basically from the point of time of the Tilray acquisition up until our reported numbers from last year, and we're expecting very, very significant growth in this year's market. As we look to our -- by fiscal year '25, as Irwin mentioned, we had 50% growth in our flower business, 22% in our extract business, where we already have a sizable market share. We do have some, as Irwin mentioned in the previous question, we have some timing with import-export permits receiving in certain countries where we ship directly to a distributor versus our own warehouses, and therefore servicing markets through third-party distributors. So there will be some lumpiness. So it's really important to look at the business on a year -- on a year basis, not necessarily on a quarter basis, to get a full picture.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay, got it. Appreciate all that. And then I just wanted to sort of more of a general question, but just given some of the growth headwinds in the domestic Canadian market, obviously, there's been a lot of attention paid, and you guys have done a lot of good strategic initiatives, whether it's International or Beverage alcohol. But on the Wellness side of things, I'm just curious if there's any sort of M&A opportunities you think within there, or do you think this is more of a sort of organic growth story from the exposure you guys already have?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Well, in regards to Wellness, I think, listen, there's a lot of the medical in Canada that's coming over, and they're going into the -- you know, going into recreational and buying it there. But medical is something that we're focused on. We see tremendous use for the product, whether it's anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy. So there's a big medical opportunity for us. Is there acquisitions for us in that area? That is an area that we are focused on in regards to the medical part of the business. But I think the whole thing is, again, is our research that we're focused on medical, which is a big commitment for us. And being the number one medical producer in Europe, there's a lot we're learning there, and there's a lot as we work with universities and research that we're sharing back and forth, matter of fact, we're in Europe next week with our Canadian teams and our European teams working on multiple things there. So, yes, medical is a big part of our growth, and medical is something that's very, very important to us in the Canadian market.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley: Okay. Thanks all.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Good morning. I don't think I heard the fiscal '25 revenue guidance, which had been $950 million to $1 billion. Is that still the expectation for the year? And then, if I recall, that guidance had included some M&A, some expectation for some M&A, was the recent acquisition of the brands from Molson Coors, the M&A that was contemplated in that guidance, or is there still more implied?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So that was the guidance for the year. There is some M&A in there. We have not updated our guidance to include the Molson's acquisition.\\n\\nBill Kirk: Okay. And then on the International side, like I understand that it's up over a few years, it has been in that like, $11 million to $14 million on a per quarter basis for a little while, despite new positive developments. So, like what's offsetting the new positive developments in kind of on a more narrow timeframe?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: So thank you for the question. The international business, basically, if you remember, we used to actually, there's been some ins and outs, I think, in terms of the business. So it's not exactly on apples-to-apples. If you recall, a couple of years ago, Israel was actually a very big part of our revenue number. And if you might remember that it's been about a year and a half ago, two years ago, we discontinued our business in Israel. Just given the state of the market there, given the influx of products, the price compression, we just didn't feel that it was a profitable market for us to continue. So we discontinued those sales, which were quite sizable. However, in replacing that, we have sought out additional new countries. We entered Poland, we entered the U.K., Italy and Portugal. We've also identified a bunch of other countries which we will be entering. So stay tuned for that in future quarters. This business, as Irwin mentioned before, the Canadian business was just a few years old. The business in Europe is even more underdeveloped and immature at this point. And so, in essence, it really is just starting to grow and take off now. And so, I think it's still early innings for this business. We are very bullish about it going forward. And as Irwin mentioned, we look to invest -- we've already invested and we will continue to invest.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: I just think, again, you got to come back, there's been some currency effect in Europe that affected us, as you look at it. But Denise mentioned, as we look at this from a profitability, Europe is very profitable for us. And I think that's what's very important is as we focus on profitability. The other thing is Germany being the biggest market there, and we were restricted with our facility in Germany that we only could sell to the German government at a loss. That has changed. So we were losing money in regards to a tender that was awarded five years ago, and we've been able to renegotiate that tender and renegotiate the terms of that. The second thing is, as each country legalizes, and we're not dealing with states here, we're dealing with different countries with different regulatory. So building out the European market absolutely has been difficult. And there's markets that we've abandoned. We are not selling into the Israeli market, which used to be one of the biggest markets for us. So, what I can reassure you is, there's tremendous opportunities of growth. We only really sell flower and tinctures. It's not like we're selling pre-rolls and we're selling multiple different products here. We're selling over 100 different products, but it's basically flower and tinctures, and that's it. So we look for Europe to be a big opportunity. We are the largest grower of cannabis in Europe today. We have the infrastructure on the ground, taking a little time, but what's important to us is the profitability there. The other thing is we're vertically integrated with our CC Pharma, CC -- our Tilray Pharma there in regards to distributing through the drugstores. So, yes, you know, it's not growing as fast, but it is a very profitable business for us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the Delta-9 beverages. It's been tough in the cannabis space at least, really, building brands that kind of parallel to how they've developed in other categories. And so this is an interesting case to see how it plays out. But I guess with that in mind, you have four brands, I think you mentioned, you've got teed up and more to come. Why so many? And how do you plan to develop those and set them up for sustainable growth?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, number one, the brands are developed, and again we've had Happy Flower out there for a long time with CBD 420 is one of our brands that are known. Two or three of our other brands have some uniqueness to them. So, again, with our five different products out there, it gives us differentiation in products, it allows us to have multiple products out there. And so far, everything we have shown retailers, distributors, they've liked, and we got quite a few orders. So, yes, 420 is a brand that's well-known out there. Happy Flower has been out there. We have to build some of our other brands out there, and we've done that before, as we've come out with new products in regards to Runner's High, which is our non-alc beer and our Montauk non-alc beer, our Liquid Love is our water brand that's coming out there. Our Delta-9, our new brand. Listen, the big thing is out there. We got products. We've developed these flavors. We developed these products from scratch. We got 700 distributors out there, and these distributors want it now, we only can sell it in the states that is legal. And we got field salespeople out there on the street that will make sure we get this product in the hands. The last but not least, which is important, how do we market that to the consumer? And that's what's important for us to make sure we're getting the message across to the consumer. There's some really good products that we're coming up with.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Yes, no, so that's helpful. And then just on some of the -- you touched on some of the integration of beer production and how you've got more flexibility now. How significant can that be and how quickly could it come in terms of just, would we be right to think that you could consolidate some facilities or how do we just think about what to expect in the next several quarters for how that impacts your numbers?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, no, good question there. Listen, we're in a category today where the craft beer industry is declining 3%, but there's $100 billion worth of beer sold out there. So it's not like a small category. So there is tremendous opportunities in the craft beer business, okay? And with that, we think we can go out there and take share with innovation, with some of the new products that we've launched. We think we come back and look at whether it's the non-alc industry that's growing tremendously within Delta-9. The other thing is, we're going back to each of our brands today. We have 19 brands out there, and we're looking at these brands where they should be sold regionally and what should be a national brand. Shock Top definitely should be a national brand. But if you take Montauk, you take Blue Point and take SweetWater, and you focus them sort of in the Northeast, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, maybe Florida, that's over 100 million people that we can market our brands to. We don't need to be in every single state out there and ship 10,000, 20,000 cases there, spend money on it where we're not going to get the lift. If you come back and look at SweetWater, SweetWater grew a 2.5 million, 3 million case brand. But it went into certain states, whether it's Ohio or Illinois, it didn't make sense in those states, California. So what we're going to do is take these brands, focus on three, four, five states, put our money behind them, work with the distributors, educate the consumers about them, and then take our national brands like a Shock Top. And the other thing, what we're going to look at this here, if we have a pumpkin beer, we'll have pumpkin beer in similar flavors for Montauk, for Blue Point. We're not going to have all these multiple different formulas out there with a lot of complexity. So we're looking at how we take our tail of our brands. We're looking at how to take complexity out of our business. We're going to do some SKU rationalization. And with this, it will optimize and right-size our footprint and the buying power today with over 15 million cases of beer that we're buying. And if we have to consolidate some of our facilities, which we're right now looking at, we ultimately will, but we really feel, you know, within a matter since 2020, we're now the fifth largest craft brewer out there with a 5% share out there. And we think we can get this category growing again through our innovation, through our distribution. And I got to tell you, working with distributors out there, they all want to see growth, they all want to see new innovation, they want to see products. And the same with the retailers. The retailers are looking at there's way too many brands, way too many products, how do we ultimately get this category growing, because it takes up too much space in stores.\\n\\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Irwin, maybe can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about U.S. plan touching assets? We've seen other companies that set up ring fence structures, Canopy USA, SNDL with SunStream, OGI has talked about that also. I mean, there's been more consolidation, and we would come to a point that there won't be much left to buy. So how do you handicap that? And how do you think about, you know, doing something similar in the current context of regulation?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So I step back, and listen, the good news is the two presidential candidates are in favor of legalization. And I think in regards to rescheduling, there's, in December, the recommendations are going to come up on that. So, Pablo, I think something will happen in regards to rescheduling, and something will happen in regards to Federal legalization, whether it's medical cannabis that will be legalized and ultimately leave it up to the states for everything else. If you come back and look at what we can do, remember, we've gone in once Canada was legalized five years ago, they tell me it's six years ago, but I think it's still five, it was 2018, so I guess that is six years ago. If you come back and look at it, we built our Canadian business to a $300-plus million business from scratch. And we built it -- we built grow facilities, we built brands, we built vertical integration. And today, as being one of the largest growers up there with almost 5 million square feet, we know how to grow cannabis. We know we have the genetic base. We know how to -- you know, make pre-rolls, we know how to make tinctures, we know how to make drinks. We'll sell this year close to 9 million cans of cannabis-infused drinks. So we have, you know, the DNA, we have the know-how. You know we're one of the largest medical cannabis companies in Canada and in Europe. So with that, we're ready to do it on our own in the U.S., depending upon what the guidelines and the parameters are. And on the other hand, with our balance sheet, where it is today, we have the ability to go out and acquire a great strategic partner that can help us, but that makes sense. The other thing in the U.S. today, we have 18 beer brands or 19 beer brands. We have multiple brands in our spirits business, and we have our wellness brand in Manitoba Harvest. Can these brands parlay over into the cannabis category like we're doing with some of these in Delta-9? So again, I think, with cannabis going to legalize, and that's my opinion, I have nothing else, you know, any other insight, we will be ready to jump into which way we can jump in there and be ready for it.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you. And one last one, maybe for Denise, just going back to the discussion in Germany, maybe using some Michael Porter's terms here, but maybe remind us of your competitive advantage there, your competitive assets, your asset strengths. What are the barriers to entry? Because what I hear, there's all these licensed importers that are able to bring products, we saw a big jump apparently in imports in the second and third quarter, and then they are able to go to doctors, promote those products, and sell them to the consumers, right? So I don't know if I want to see more fragmentation as opposed to consolidation in Germany. But I'm sure you have assets on the ground that give you an advantage. But I'm just trying to understand how the German market plays out in terms of fragmentation versus consolidation. Just importers versus local producers. And what's your edge? And why should we assume that you are better positioned than others? If you can just mention that. And as part of that, a quick reminder, if you produce, if you jump production in Germany by five times, I suppose that replaces Portugal or Canada, does that mean that you end up with a higher cost structure? Thank you.\\n\\nDenise Faltischek: Thanks, Pablo, and thank you for the question. I think, also I just want to also bring back to the previous question that was asked, because I think it -- I was remiss in not stating the fact that if you look at our year-over-year growth between FY24 and FY23 in terms of the European market, we grew that market 34%. So I just wanted to actually finish off that last question, which I didn't do the last time. In terms of Germany, I think you are 100% right in terms of our uniquely positioned in Germany and in Europe, in particular. We mentioned Aphria RX facility with our ability under our new -- our newly issued license, we have the ability to produce to full capacity, which basically allows us to produce five times what we were able to produce under the tender. In addition, we expanded that license, under the tender we were permitted to produce three strains. Today, we now are able to do 31 cultivars, and I'm proud to say that actually what just landed at Neumunster is a bunch of cultivars from our Canadian facilities, where we look at those cultivars that perform best in market in Canada. And we've shipped those cultivars over to both Portugal and Aphria RX in order to provide ourselves with the maximum flexibility both in supply chain, as well as the availability of products to patients. Having that facility, as well as our Portugal facility, as well as we've opened up the ability to deliver product from Canada, we have the -- probably what I would -- what I would classify as the most flexible supply chain of any cannabis company in Europe where we see many of -- and you mentioned about whether there's segmentation and consolidation, and as you know, there is a few larger players in the Canadian -- in the German market, but there's, and then there's a proliferation of a lot of smaller, smaller companies that are -- that are coming online and starting and continue in German market. I do think at some point there will be consolidation, just because if you have a lot of players in a market, you will start to see consolidation of those players. But going back to our unique position, we have the most flexible supply chain, we have a great cost structure. Given the work that we've done in order to make sure that we always keep our cost to produce very low and we're very efficient. In addition, we have a terrific first-class commercial team located in Europe and with boots on the ground in Germany. We have a sales team that is very well positioned in terms of their knowledge, their reputation with doctors, their reputation with government officials, and the fact of the matter of being one of the first in Germany has given us a reputation of being trusted and having the expertise. So as doctors want to learn more and more about medical cannabis in light of the new regulations, we are one of the first that they seek out in order to get that information because they want to know how to prescribe and they want to know how to continue in the market.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the quarterly results in beverage. I didn't hear whether you said that those -- the sales were in line or a little below expectations. I think you said cannabis was in line or better. So can you just tell us like, just how did beverage do versus you thought? The tracking data shows the brands are down a bit. Do they just need like -- is it a matter of timing before your new marketing efforts and your consolidation efforts take hold before the retail sales get a little bit better?\\n\\nIrwin Simon: So, Robert, thank you. We don't give guidance out there by the major businesses, but we have definitely internal guidance and internal budgets. The beverage business was off a bit and a lot of that is just timing on some of the new products and a lot of it is the products are ready, it's when the distributors ultimately take them, and that was the biggest thing. The other thing which you heard me talk about earlier is right-sizing the business here and going through our SKU rationalization, going through our brand rationalization, and going through our distribution white space. Also there is timing in regards to customers taking new products in, products for Halloween, products -- our pumping products, and some of the different things like that. So just a timing standpoint. But the other one was integration of some of the ABI brands back into our facilities and supplies. So it's just from a timing standpoint, it's a timing standpoint. If you look at our quarterly -- if you look at our numbers here, our SG&A was way up in regards to our beverage business. But as we build out the infrastructure and build out people and take over the ABI business and do some of the spending, we expect to get the benefits from that over the year. So with that, we are excited to what we see that's happening out there. We think we're well positioned with our brands, with our products, with our innovation. Our customers are giving us good feedback. We have a lot of high hopes for Delta-9, we have a lot of high hopes for our non-alc, we have a lot of hopes for our Liquid Love. We'll have a lot of hopes for some of the new innovation that's coming out under SweetWater, Montauk, and 10 Barrel, and which, again, which is not really in our numbers, with the acquisition that we just acquired, the four brands from Molson Coors, and getting our hands around them and seeing the growth opportunities with that. So with that, it's just early timing in regards to our beverage business, but there is a real, real, real good plan in place there, Robert.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Simon for any final comments.\\n\\nIrwin Simon: Thank you very much, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud and excited of what we've been able to put together over the last five-plus years. As you heard our guidance out there is $950 million to $1 billion of size, and that's coming from a startup basically at $50 million. Today, we have over 44 brands. We have 2,700 people that work within this company today. We have plenty facilities, we sell in over 20 countries, six different continents. And again, we are dealing in categories where regulation is important. There is no one company out there that does what we do as diversified as us. So it's not easy. And there's a lot of noise and a lot of news every day coming up about cannabis. As we sit here and wait, there's a lot of changes that got to happen. But again, the cannabis industry in the U.S. is over $40-plus billion in total size. So there's a big, big, big market out there. You look at the total beer industry out there and the size just of the craft industry, there's a big business out there. You look at the wellness industry and some of the stuff that we're doing with hemp and that grew about 11% in the quarter. So we're well positioned. If you come back and look at our balance sheet, and that's something I think that's hurt a lot of other companies out there in the cannabis industry, is we really have managed our balance sheet, managed our cash situation, managed paying down debt. In our last quarter, we paid down over $300 million of our convertible debt. So we're focused on this and pulling all this together. Are we totally happy with our stock performance? No. But I don't think it reflects of what this company has done over the last five years and how we put together some great brands, great people, a great strategy, and how we're diversified out there. And we're a global company in the CPG industry. So, I feel there's exciting times ahead. You have great brands, you have a really committed team. We have a tight, tight strategy out there. We have great partners with our distributors, our retailers, our consumers, who we're marketing to. And last but not least, our aim is to please our shareholders and reward our shareholders. With that, thank you very much and enjoy your day. Go Mets, go Yankees. And you go to Citi Field, you'll find our beer. You go to San Diego, you'll find our beers. So we want stadiums that are in the playoffs that are selling our beers. So with that, be safe out there, and thank you for joining us.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"British Airways cancels hundreds of flights because of Rolls-Royce engine issues\\n\\nChris Price\\n\\nOctober 11, 2024 at 8:27 PM\\n\\nBritish Airways scrapped hundreds of long-haul flights as maintenance issues with its Rolls-Royce jet engines grounded aircraft.\\n\\nThe carrier has halted the launch of services to Malaysia, halved frequencies to Qatar and suspended services between Gatwick airport and New York JFK - affecting travel plans for thousands of people.\\n\\nBA said it was forced into the measures because of excessive wear and tear to the Trent 1000 engines that power its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets.\\n\\nRolls-Royce has been unable to supply enough replacement engines and parts to keep all of the 787s flying, leading five to be grounded. This equates to 15pc of the fleet.\\n\\nBoeing 777s, which had been standing in for the stricken planes, have also been overworked to such an extent that they too require visits to the workshop.\\n\\nA BA spokesperson said: \\\"We've taken this action because we do not believe the issue will be solved quickly, and we want to offer our customers the certainty they deserve\\n\\n\\\"We've apologised to those affected and are able to offer the vast majority a flight the same day with British Airways or one of our partner airlines.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to work closely with Rolls-Royce to ensure the company is aware of the impact its issues are having on our schedule and customers, and seek reassurance of a prompt and reliable solution.\\\"\\n\\nBA said the launch of a new Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur route will be delayed from November to April next year.\\n\\nOne of two daily trips from Heathrow to Doha will be scrapped until March, while flights from Gatwick to JFK will be suspended from early December for the whole of the winter season.\\n\\nBA warned there will also be a number of cancellations on other long-haul routes between now and January.\\n\\nIt said the bulk of passengers affected will be accommodated on its own flights, including eight daily services from Heathrow to New York, or with partners including Qatar Airways.\\n\\nThe carrier had already scrapped 11 round-trip services due to the Rolls-Royce issues. It is understood that the situation has been exacerbated by a strike over pay at Boeing, which has held up supplies of some other parts.\\n\\nBA has started to contact customers whose flights have been cancelled to offer alternative travel arrangements and laying the blame squarely at the door of Rolls.\\n\\n\\\"Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges,\\\" it said.\\n\\n\\\"We're not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation.\\\"\\n\\nA Rolls-Royce spokesman said: \\\"We continue to work with British Airways and all of our customers to minimise the impact of the limited availability of spares due to the current supply chain constraints. Unfortunately, this is an issue affecting the whole aerospace industry.\\\"\\n\\nRead the latest updates below.\\n\\n06:22 PM BST\\n\\nSigning off...\\n\\nThanks for joining us today.\\n\\nWe will be back on the Markets blog on Monday morning but do keep up with all our latest business news, analysis and comment over the weekend here.\\n\\n06:04 PM BST\\n\\nUS banking giants say consumers still spending\\n\\nAmerican consumers remain resilient and are continuing to spending, two of the country's biggest lenders said on Friday.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum, chief financial officer of JPMorgan, said:\\n\\nOverall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid. [They are] consistent with the narrative that consumers are on solid footing and consistent with a strong labour market and the current central case of a kind of 'no-landing' scenario economically.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Michael Santomassimo, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo chief financial officer, said spending on credit and debit cards, while down a little from earlier this year, was still \\\"quite solid.\\\"\\n\\nThe market will get a fuller picture when Bank of America and Citigroup, the country's other two major consumer banks, report next week and retail sales data is released. Several investors said Friday's earnings were so far a positive sign.\\n\\nTaylor Krystkowiak, at invesment firm Themes ETFs, said:\\n\\nThe fact that ... not only are we averting a hard landing, there might even be a chance that there's no landing, and that we're able to continue to push forward is definitely going to be a big windfall for banks.\\n\\nStill, Mr Santomassimo warned that the cumulative impact of higher inflation was stretching lower-income consumers and the bank was watching to see if that pattern spread to higher income customers.\\n\\n05:57 PM BST\\n\\nUber shares jump in response to unveiling of Tesla's robotaxi\\n\\nShares in ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft were both up about 10pc today, as analysts said the lack of details on Tesla's robotaxis eased competition worries for the companies.\\n\\nLast night electronic dance music-infused event run by Elon Musk failed to impress shareholders. Some investors and experts said they were hoping for more concrete details on how the company plans to transform from an automaker into an autonomous driving and artificial intelligence titan with a solid business plan.\\n\\nTesla shares fell nearly 8pc in Friday trading. The stock, which has been pummeled in recent years by fears of cheaper EV rivals eating into Tesla's market share, is up nearly 50pc since April when Musk announced the shift to robotaxis. Still, shares are down 8pc over the last year, compared with a 33pc increase in the broad-market S&P 500 index.\\n\\nRoss Gerber, a Tesla shareholder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said:\\n\\nHis vision is lovely, but somebody has to actualise it. For now, for the next 24 months, Tesla has to sell EVs. Why aren't we focused on that?\\n\\nMr Gerber said he was happy to see products like the Cybercab and the robovan, but hoped to also see a more traditional, lower-priced mass-market vehicle that the company could sell in the near future.\\n\\nMusk had for years pledged to sell a car expected to start at about $25,000, which investors saw as critical to winning new customers. It was reported in April that Tesla had abandoned this project.\\n\\n05:21 PM BST\\n\\nS&P 500 hits new record as it passes 5,800 milestone\\n\\nWall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, rose above 5,800 for the first time after America's biggest companies began issuing their earnings reports.\\n\\nThe index is up 0.5pc this evening Banking stocks are among the biggest risers today after several financial giants released strong results.\\n\\nWells Fargo is up 6pc, JP Morgan is up 5.1pc and Bank of America, which reports next week, is up 5.1pc\\n\\n05:07 PM BST\\n\\nEuropean stocks close up\\n\\nThe major European stock markets rose today, with the pan-European stock index reversing early losses to end up by 0.5pc.\\n\\nThe FTSE 100 edged up 0.2pc, while Germany's Dax and Spain's Ibex closed up 0.7pc and 0.5pc respectively.\\n\\nFrance's blue-chip Cac 40 reversed early losses and ended higher after the government delivered its 2025 budget with plans for \\u20ac60bn (\\u00a350bn) worth of spending cuts and tax hikes on the wealthy and big companies.\\n\\nMarkets finished a volatile week that saw Shanghai markets drop on uncertainty around policy support, oil prices spike on Middle East tensions and US data raise doubts about sustained cooling of inflation.\\n\\nDaniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said:\\n\\nWe're now in that limbo phase where economies are not expecting to plunge into recession, rates are still high, there's no clear path on interest rate cuts and earnings have been resilient, but again the expectations were pretty low.\\n\\nOverall, there was a sense of caution as investors awaited China finance ministry's press conference on Saturday, with expectations of stimulus announcements running high.\\n\\n04:58 PM BST\\n\\nVirtually no housebuilders believe Starmer will hit target of building 1.5m homes\\n\\nAlmost no housebuilders believe Sir Keir Starmer will reach his target of building 1.5m homes in the next five years, a new survey has found.\\n\\nJust 2pc of housebuilders are confident of the sector's ability to meet the Government's pledge to deliver at least 300,000 homes per year, according to findings from Knight Frank's upcoming land index and housebuilder survey.\\n\\nBy contrast, 98pc of housebuilders expect to produce much lower volumes.\\n\\nIn total, 85pc said the sector could only deliver up to 1m homes - equalling 200,000 per year - over the next five years.\\n\\nOf that 85pc, around 40pc thought the sector's capacity would fall below one million.\\n\\nThe findings underline a crucial gap between the Government's ambitions and what the industry believes it can deliver. In July, Angela Rayner, the Housing Secretary, raised the national housebuilding target to 370,000 per year.\\n\\nRead the full story...\\n\\n04:52 PM BST\\n\\nFTSE closes up\\n\\nThe FTSE 100 closed up this afternoon by 0.2pc.\\n\\nThe top riser was Endeavour Mining, up 2.6pc, followed by packaging giant DS Smith, up 2.5pc.\\n\\nAt the other end of the index, Sainsbury's dropped 5.9pc, followed by Prudential, down 1.7pc.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.4pc\\n\\nThe top riser was Hochschild Mining, up 6.9pc, followed by Auction Technology, up 3.8pc.\\n\\nThe biggest faller was Dowlais, down 5.2pc, followed by Ocado, down 2.4pc.\\n\\n04:42 PM BST\\n\\nInvestors await signs of progress at Premier Inn owner amid restructuring\\n\\nInvestors will be hoping hotel and pub owner Whitbread can reveal strong progress in a trading update next week amid a recent restructuring and tough market conditions.\\n\\nShares in the FTSE 100 group have sagged over the past year as pressure on customer finances has impacted spending on hotel visits and eating out.\\n\\nIn its previous update, the Premier Inn owner said total group sales increased by 1pc to \\u00a3739m for the three months to May 30.\\n\\nHowever, it indicated that they were 1pc down year on year over the first seven weeks of the second quarter.\\n\\nDemand in the quarter, from the start of June until the end of August, will have also been affected by continued weak weather conditions.\\n\\nThe company did highlight in its previous update that accommodation demand had recovered to move in line with the previous year.\\n\\nAnalysts at Bernstein have indicated revenues per available room are likely to have improve from a 2pc decline in the first quarter to just a 0.4pc drop in the latest quarter.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank analysts have meanwhile suggested the company could report a \\\"solid\\\" first-half but are facing a \\\"red October\\\", with industry data pointing to below-par consumer spending.\\n\\nSales increased in both July and August across hospitality venues including pubs and restaurants, but this growth was below the rate of inflation in both months, pointing to weaker activity from Britons.\\n\\nIn April, the group - which also owns the Beefeater and Brewer's Fayre brands - revealed a shake-up at its food and beverage division, due to weak performances among some brands.\\n\\nIt said it would cut its branded restaurants by more than 200 in favour of building more hotel rooms, leading to 1,500 job cut.\\n\\n04:32 PM BST\\n\\nLabour to start trade talks with Switzerland\\n\\nSir Keir Starmer's administration is to restart trade talks with Switzerland on Monday, with negotiators meeting for the first time since the election.\\n\\nJonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, is attempting to sign more trade agreements without reopening the wounds over Brexit.\\n\\nBefore the election, he rejected the idea of rejoining the EU single market, saying that he preferred \\\"practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets\\\".\\n\\nThe aim of the Swiss negotiations is to develop \\\"an enhanced and upgraded free trade agreement\\\", the Department for Business and Trade said today. \\\"The current UK-Switzerland trade deal is largely based on an EU-Swiss deal from 1972 and does not cover digital trade or data flows. However, 80pc of all services exported from the UK to Switzerland were digitally delivered in 2021.\\\"\\n\\n04:10 PM BST\\n\\nBoss of Fiat owner says car-making in Italy is too expensive\\n\\nThe head of Fiat and Jeep maker Stellantis told Italian parliamentarians today that producing cars in Italy was too expensive due to energy costs, while demand for electric vehicles would only come through bold incentives.\\n\\nCarlos Tavares, chief executive, told a parliamentary hearing that the carmaker had planned new vehicles for all its factories in Italy \\\"until 2030, in some cases until 2033.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it is not enough. The problem is the costs that are too high in Italy, 40 percent higher than those that our competitors have to bear,\\\" said Mr Tavares, in comments published by Italy's AGI agency.\\n\\nMr Tavares cited the \\\"very high\\\" cost of energy in Italy, double that of in Spain.\\n\\n\\\"It's a huge disadvantage, it doesn't allow us to maintain [profit] margins,\\\" he added. \\\"Producing vehicles that can't be purchased by the middle class because they cost too much is useless.\\\"\\n\\nReferring to electric cars, Mr Tavares pointed the finger at Italian lawmakers, saying it was their responsibility to spur demand.\\n\\n\\\"Why don't we sell electric cars in Italy? They cost too much. We need to make them accessible through incentives and subsidies. How?... It's your decision. To support demand, we need big incentives, otherwise we won't make it,\\\" he said.\\n\\nTensions have been mounting for several months between the government of Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, and Stellantis. Rome has accused the multinational of relocating its production to low-cost countries to the detriment of Italian factories.\\n\\n04:03 PM BST\\n\\nUK bonds sold at fastest pace since Truss mini-Budget crisis, says Wall Street bank\\n\\nClients at a Wall Street bank have been selling UK bonds at the fastest pace since the Liz Truss mini-Budget crisis, it has been reported.\\n\\nThe yield on 10-year gilts has risen from 3.76pc in mid-September to 4.23pc, its highest level since July, pushing up the cost of government borrowing.\\n\\nThe yield, which moves inversely to a bond's price, is the return the government promises to pay buyers of its debt.\\n\\nBond yields notably surged in 2022 after a steep sell-off by bond market vigilantes following Liz Truss's unfunded tax cuts and spending, announced in her mini-Budget, which eventually led to her downfall as prime minister.\\n\\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, known as BNY, said customers were offloading UK bonds, known as gilts, ahead of Rachel Reeves' Budget later this month.\\n\\nGeoff Yu, senior EMEA market strategist at BNY, told Reuters:\\n\\nUK gilt markets recently faced the most concentrated round of selling by UK and international clients since the mini-budget of 2022.\\n\\nHe said clients sold \\u00a33.04bn of gilts last month.\\n\\n03:56 PM BST\\n\\nWall Street rises despite hit from Tesla\\n\\nThe S&P 500 rose and the Dow hit a record high this afternoon, driven by gains in major banks following third-quarter results. Meanwhile mixed producer price index data had the effect of reinforcing expectations for a quarter point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in November.\\n\\nHowever, the tech-heavy Nasdaq struggled due to an 7.4pc drop in Tesla, after the EV maker unveiled its long awaited robotaxi, but did not provide details on how fast it could ramp up production or deal with potential regulatory hurdles.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2pc, the S&P 500 rose 0.5pc, and the Nasdaq - after opening in negative territory - rose 0.2pc.\\n\\n03:43 PM BST\\n\\nUS consumer sentiment drops but spending may still be strong, says economist\\n\\nA closely watched survey of American consumer sentiment shows a drop during October, with the index going into reverse after two months of gains.\\n\\nSentiment dropped 1.7pc to 68.9 in the University of Michigan survey, while a forward-looking index of consumer expectations dropped 2pc to 72.9. Both indexes are up year on year.\\n\\nBradley Saunders, a North America economist at Capital Economics said:\\n\\nThe trivial fall in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index in October was likely driven in part by Hurricane Helene, although the fall in the expectations index suggests the mood among households may have soured more generally.\\n\\nIn any case, the poor link between confidence and consumption in recent years means consumption growth may not be as weak as suggested.\\n\\n03:34 PM BST\\n\\nNetflix can get away with hiking prices, says broker\\n\\nNetflix could raise prices by 12pc without problems, a leading broker has said, as the streaming giant prepares to announce its quarterly results next week.\\n\\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said:\\n\\nWith Netflix investing heavily in new content and features, this could be a good time to raise prices...\\n\\nA price increase may not prove too controversial [after] Netflix saw its subscriber base grow when it cracked down on password sharing. Added to that, a Netflix subscription is considered a necessity for some, and an affordable luxury for others, that saves on the cost of a night out or a trip to the cinema. Thus, we believe that price increases could be absorbed well by a global audience hooked on Netflix shows.\\n\\nThe company may choose to announce any potential price increases at a later date; however, we think that if price hikes are not formally announced on the 17th, then they may tout the possibility of the increase on next week's [earnings] call...\\n\\nAnalysts are expecting a strong set of results for Netflix. If it can meet analyst expectations, then [that] would be a growth rate of 38.4pc year on year. Revenues are forecast to rise 14.4pc year on year, with net income expected to be more than 33pc higher on an annual basis.\\n\\nThe market is expecting Netflix's growth rate to be stronger than its peers in the streaming sector, and if Netflix reports a strong quarter of results, it could solidify its position as the top global streaming service and pulling further away from the likes of Disney+ and Paramount.\\n\\n03:32 PM BST\\n\\nTesla event 'light of real numbers'\\n\\nTesla was accused of lacking details at the unveiling of its robotaxi - named Cybercab - which is designed to autonomously drive passengers without the need for a steering wheel or pedals.\\n\\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said: \\\"Investors we spoke to at the event thought the event was light of real numbers and timelines.\\\"\\n\\nNancy Tengler, a Tesla investor who attended the event, told Bloomberg: \\\"The only specific was the $30,000 for a Cybercab. The concepts were all grand. Is the idea super cool?

      "    \"title\": \"Tesla robotaxi stock reaction, Nike's new CEO: Catalysts\",\n",
      "    \"body\": \"The first full hour of Friday's trading session is chock full of knowledge, and luckily Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills are here to disseminate the top market and economic stories alongside leading Wall Street experts. The pair break October's preliminary consumer sentiment data, which dropped to a reading of 68.9, at the top of the show.\\n\\nTesla (TSLA) stock has fallen since CEO Elon Musk unveiled its autonomous Cybercab at the company's Robotaxi Day event last night. Hamilton Capital Partners chief investment officer Alonso Munoz and Roth MKM managing director Rohit Kulkarni join the program to both share their respective thoughts on Tesla's full autonomous vehicle pivot and its subsequent stock price reaction.\\n\\nFormer Nike (NKE) executive Elliott Hill will assume the role of CEO on Monday, October 14, after the ousting of chief executive John Donahoe. Truist analyst Joseph Civello comes onto the show to discuss what this leadership changeup can mean for Nike investor sentiments.\\n\\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\\n\\nAnd we have breaking news out at the top of the hour preliminary reading on consumer sentiment data for October that coming out and a bit of a disappointment here, relative to expectations, we saw sentiment falling from the previous reading dropping to 68.9.\\n\\nSo again, coming in well below those expectations there.\\n\\nAnd of course, the big takeaway is what this tells us about the health and stability and really the confidence of the consumer right now, when you take that into account with the fact that we have been getting some mixed data out when it comes to inflation and maybe the fact that that move lower, the softening inflation won't be study as a decline that many economists or strategists have been hoping for or expecting when you see a print like this consumer sentiment declining a bit more than expected.\\n\\nThere.\\n\\nObviously not necessarily to welcome news here for the market, but we're not seeing that large of a reaction here play out at least right now in stocks matty.\\n\\nIt's interesting, the one year inflation expectations coming in at 2.9% that is slightly above the reading here, which was 2.7% in the estimate was also 2.7%.\\n\\nAgain, that headline number you're looking at on your screen coming in at 68.9 below the expectation of 71 here.\\n\\nIt's interesting to following the CP I print that we got and the PP I print as well looking at some information indicating that inflation could be ticking back up again.\\n\\nI want to flip the board if we can from the control room over to treasure to take a look at how we're doing there because we did see yields taking higher on the heels of yesterday's inflation print then taking lower after the jobs print, you can see here a little bit of a mixed picture.\\n\\nYou've got the five year and 10 year moving the downside of touch, but the 30 year yield just above the flat line there as we digest the consumer sentiment data coming in again, indicating inflation expectations perhaps a touch higher than anticipated.\\n\\nWell as the market is digesting the latest economic data, we are approaching the two year anniversary of the bull market.\\n\\nSo how could the health of the consumer impact market momentum going forward for more on this?\\n\\nWe've got Matthew Paolo.\\n\\nHe is a senior investment strategist over at Bernstein Private Wealth Management.\\n\\nMatthew, it's great to have you on here.\\n\\nSo as we're getting in this consumer sentiment data of feeling out there that inflation is going to be higher for longer, how big of a risk would that be if true to this bull market rally?\\n\\nLook, I, I certainly think that that is a risk um in inflation and what that means ultimately, for what the FED does on on monetary policy is probably one of the biggest risks that we see to this bull market continuing, you know, absent any surprises to the to the upside over further months and quarters.\\n\\nIt's our expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates throughout the rest of this year into 2025 and probably get the FED funds rate down to about 3% which would be a fairly conducive environment for equity investors.\\n\\nSo it's our expectation the bull market continues into next year, but that the returns for equity investors probably are more modest than they have been over the last couple of years.\\n\\nSo maybe it won't necessarily be a repeat of what we have seen those massive gains, the upside and Matthew, I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out what that leadership is going to look like, right?\\n\\nHow much of a rotation we're going to see maybe out of these larger cap tech names, which, which sectors are best positioned at this point.\\n\\nHow are you adjusting your portfolio then potentially for the for this next leg of the bull market?\\n\\nYeah, so, so I think we're, we're certainly encouraged by the results in, in the third quarter.\\n\\nIf you were to look at the returns across the, the S and P 500 there was much broader participation than there was over the previous quarters or, or even the previous couple of years.\\n\\nSo that um has, has allowed us to gain a little bit more confidence in our positioning.\\n\\nWe tend to be very, very diversified investors owning um not just the top leadership names but also those across the board where we find either undervalued opportunities or, or companies that um maybe haven't been in the, the sites of, of uh broader investors.\\n\\nSo, uh we're, we're thinking that we're going to continue to see more leadership out of the rest of the, the index.\\n\\nAnd, you know, if you look at valuations that, that's supportive of that and the, the leadership that you've seen over the last couple of years, those companies are, are fairly expensive.\\n\\nAnd so, you know, we're seeing less expensive, more, more opportunity further down the line and I think that continues like we saw in the third quarter into 2025.\\n\\nMatthew, you sound like Jamie Diamond this morning a little bit.\\n\\nHe talked about how market levels are slightly inflated and markets.\\n\\nUh Again, you know, if you look at the, the S and P 500 in aggregate, we're trading north of 22 times forward earnings, which at least historically has been at the upper end of the range, but for bubble territory.\\n\\nUm but if you were to exclude those, those top companies, the magnificent seven or the top to top 10 names in the S and P 500 the market is not as expensive.\\n\\nAnd so, you know, it's hard to look in aggregate.\\n\\nUm again, you know, the companies that are beyond the, those top leaders in the index are, are more in line with their long term average.\\n\\nThat being said, uh we're not expecting much more valuation uh expansion over the next 12 to 15 months.\\n\\nWe think the major driver of equity market returns is really gonna come down to earnings growth, consensus earnings growth next year or for something like 10% which we think is probably a tad bit optimistic.\\n\\nWe're expecting, expecting something more like 6 to 7%.\\n\\nAnd so if you get no movement in pe multiples and the market just moves on earnings growth, you're looking at something like a mid single digit return, which again, after 2023 and 2024 that's not so bad.\\n\\nMatthew, how much does the Fed's policy play into this?\\n\\nAnd, and when we talk about the fact that we could see delays here in the rate cutting cycle.\\n\\nThere's lots of focus on November but looking out into 2025 how much is that really going to potentially weigh on earnings growth that we could see?\\n\\nEspecially next year?\\n\\nI, I think once you move past, um, an exogenous shock which again can't be forecasted at all.\\n\\nThe, the, the monetary policy and a policy error really does in our mind ends up being the the number one risk.\\n\\nUh if the Federal Reserve stays at a, a level that is restrictive for too long, unnecessarily given the, the where the economy is.\\n\\nAnd I think that is the number one risk that could bring valuations down cause a a somewhat meaningful sell off in the stock market and and probably more, more acutely hit the the economy and the consumer and the unemployment rate.\\n\\nSo, uh again, once we get past an exogenous shock, then I think a policy error from the Federal Reserve sticking around too long at a restrictive policy is what keeps us up at night.\\n\\nSo some cautious optimism there, Matthew, but I am curious, given that we are approaching this two year anniversary of the bull market here that's really been writing on the coattails of A I.\\n\\nThen we had a lot of questions about the validity of the A I rally.\\n\\nHow much is the continuation of this bull market dependent on the A I story continuing to stay intact.\\n\\nI I think in the near term or over the next year or so, it's not dependent on the A I story.\\n\\nUm continuing to, to bear as much fruit as it has over the last 12 to 18 months or so longer term.\\n\\nWe certainly think that that artificial intelligence is going to benefit the broad swath of economies, not just the technology leaders.\\n\\nAnd so that'll have benefits to, to productivity, to GDP growth to top line and bottom line.\\n\\nSo we are optimistic about A I but but not necessarily that it's going to continue to be the main story or the only story through 2025.\\n\\nThanks so much for joining us, Bernstein's Private Wealth Management, Senior Investment strategist.\\n\\nThanks Matthew, my pleasure as earnings season kicks off Goldman Sachs out with a note on single stock of volatility hitting record highs.\\n\\nThey were talking about the movement that we saw last quarter, but they put in perspective for what we could expect this quarter.\\n\\nAnd Goldman saying that they expect volatility to continue this cycle with options, market planning, a move of 6% on either side for stocks on earnings days.\\n\\nAnd I think that's very much what investors are trying to figure out just how big of a movement we will likely see.\\n\\nThere has been some conflicting commentary out from the street just in terms of whether or not this will be more of a muted reaction I think to, to earning season this time around, I just asked Drew Pettitte, uh that exact question he was actually saying, and it was similar to what Goldman was saying, they are expecting these sort of outsized movements.\\n\\nAnd I think if you take into account why may be what this ultimately means?\\n\\nOf course, there's a lot that is driving the market when it comes to A I when it comes to rates when it comes to the upcoming election.\\n\\nAnd that of course, adding to some of this follow.\\n\\nAnd that's exactly what Goldman talks about in this note, right?\\n\\nThe risks of A I rates and the election.\\n\\nThose three are the key potential drivers here moving forward.\\n\\nThey talk also about single stock volatility on earnings events at a 14 year high last quarter, expecting earning day moves to continue to be elevated as we head into this earnings cycle.\\n\\nAnd this again is a look at the options market specifically, we could see movement in either direction here as you look at that chart that we had increasing moving.\\n\\nBut I do think it's interesting and kind of notes sort of what we were just talking with Matthew about, right?\\n\\nThis idea that it's not an everything lifting market moving forward.\\n\\nIt might be an individual stock pickers market as well.\\n\\nSo something we will of course continue to be talking about.\\n\\nWell, coming up, we're taking a look at some trending tickers on Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nWe'll get you the news behind the moves.\\n\\nAlso talk to one Tesla shareholder about that long awaited Cyber cab.\\n\\nScan the QR code that's on your screen right now to track the best and worst performing stocks of the session with Yahoo Finance is trending tickers page first up here, we've got the land is announcing Ceo Carlos to vs will retire at the end of his contract in early 2026.\\n\\nThis comes just a day after the company announced plans to search for a successor for alongside the ousting of the company's CFO.\\n\\nAnd now this comes Sean.\\n\\nWe talked about this a lot, but this is a company that has certainly been under pressure.\\n\\nYou can see the stock under pressure today down about 2.8% here.\\n\\nThey've had sliding sales amid the broader challenges in the ev landscape and car landscape.\\n\\nMore broadly, you can see the stock down 30% 36% over the last three months here.\\n\\nThey've also had issues with loaded inventory and delayed new models.\\n\\nThat's something that has been of particular issue when folks are speaking about the ceo's performance.\\n\\nYes, certainly.\\n\\nAnd this has been something that has been brewing just whether or not we would likely see a retirement hero or he wouldn't renew the contract when it was expired.\\n\\nAnd then of course, couple that coupling that with the CFO shake up.\\n\\nIt's been interesting with the street's reaction because I think given the fact that there is so much talk about, maybe there should be a leadership change, you would think that maybe this will be viewed as a positive here for the company going forward.\\n\\nBut I thought RB C's Tom Na Ryan did a great job of outlining maybe why that's not the case.\\n\\nAnd he talked about the fact that it, this tends to lead to a lot of uncertainty over the next couple of months or several quarters here as we do welcome in these new leaders as we do try to find out who exactly will be replace facing them.\\n\\nAnd, and then when you look forward matty to some of the issues that you were talking about, it's not necessarily something that you can fix overnight.\\n\\nWhen you talk about the swell that we're seeing in dealership inventories or aggressive pricing that they've had in North America, obviously, um challenges and a strategy that needs to see a significant shift is going to take time to work out.\\n\\nAnd I think that's maybe why you're not seeing the initial maybe more excitement from the street that maybe many had initially anticipated.\\n\\nWell, and a huge move in their executive team, you know, you can't fire the coach and the offensive director, whatever on the same day, you know.\\n\\nI mean, not a good look here, I guess going forward and then that's of course, adding to that uncertainty.\\n\\nSo we will see whether or not stante any, any other updates are coming out from ST An as we of course, are closely tracking here.\\n\\nLet's move on to Boeing Boeing, the aerospace giant filing an unfair labor practice charge against the union representing its striking workers.\\n\\nIt's accusing union leaders of not bargaining in good faith.\\n\\nJust the latest in the escalating tensions between both sides.\\n\\nI don't know how much of the move really has to do with this filing here today.\\n\\nBut again, it is interesting about the fact that the Boeing seems to be going out on the offensive and they're doing this because they're saying that the side has not been bargaining in good faith that they reluctantly have been forced to file these charges here in response to the machinist union and, and how those talks have progressed.\\n\\nAnd they say that they wanted to, I guess, depict an accurate quote unquote what they're calling an accurate picture of the events of the past few weeks.\\n\\nNow, the union saying of course, that it is willing to talk though Boeing needs to meet us at the table.\\n\\nAnd I think those two statements there just really show how far apart the two sides were at this juncture.\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nAnd it makes a lot of sense when you take a look at the stock over the last day to see it moving to the upside off of this move to the offensive from the company's new CEO.\\n\\nUh Also we heard from union laborers talking about the desire to kind of hear more from the CEO and be able to have a little bit more interfacing with him.\\n\\nI do want to see if we can pull up the two year chart for Boeing because the stock is at a two year low following the collapse of these talks heading into the strike that's been going on for about a month.\\n\\nNow, the workers recently losing access to health care and of course, their paychecks, certainly adding pressure to the conversation you can see here at the very, very end of your screen just a slight uptick at the end of the past two years here following this news and uh certainly other challenges from the company.\\n\\nIt's up about 13% of the last two years, but still a huge decline from the start of 2024 here.\\n\\nAnd finally, Tesla unveiling, long awaited cyber cab with a $30,000 price tag.\\n\\nThat was not the only product must reveal that the company's event last night.\\n\\nYahoo Finance is a for you to joins us now, with a look at Tesla's robots.\\n\\nA I know this is something that you have seen up close and personal.\\n\\nWhat can you tell us?\\n\\nYeah, we're talking specifically about those optimist robots.\\n\\nThis is a product that Musk has consistently touted as bigger than transport for Tesla.\\n\\nHe has said that humanoid robots alone could boost Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion.\\n\\nThe event last night marked the first public reveal for the latest version of the optimist but Musk has previously said that a handful of these humanoids have already been deployed at Tesla's Fremont factory here in Los Angeles.\\n\\nWe saw those robots walking on the Warner Brothers lot.\\n\\nThe first time we've seen these humanoids outside of company walls, Musk saying that he believes every person on the planet will come to own these robots in the future though.\\n\\nIt can, it'll be able to do anything you want so it can um be a teacher babysit your kids, it can walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, just be your friend, serve drinks.\\n\\nUm Whatever you can think of it will do, the price point for these robots will be key to wide adoption.\\n\\nMusk saying last night that he believes the cost will be as low as 20 to $30,000 and that is lower than the price.\\n\\nMost experts have forecast robotic engineers.\\n\\nI've been speaking with say this could be as ubiquitous as smartphones if it can sell for the price of a car.\\n\\nNow, the question is of course, the timeline, it's worth noting the idea of human like robots isn't new but generative A I has supercharged their development and Tesla faces plenty of competition in this space, especially from NVIDIA.\\n\\nThe chip giant doesn't necessarily build the hardware, but it's created an ecosystem that allows robotics companies to speed up development.\\n\\nThat means combining its chips.\\n\\nNvidia's Omniverse Foundation models that lead to faster learning and that system is being used by more than a dozen robotics companies including Figure A I which is backed by open a ironic a company we went inside for our next episode a few months ago in terms of what this means for Tesla's bottom line.\\n\\nWell, Goldman Sachs says the industry as a whole could reach a value of $38 billion.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that we've already seen the initial use cases for this.\\n\\nAmazon's deployed.\\n\\nIt's humanoid robot, digit robot in a test facility.\\n\\nBMW S factory is using figure a figure robot and the Mercedes Benz has a partnership with Apron, the company we spoke to as well.\\n\\nAnd guys, the thing that analysts have said consistently is that Tesla has the benefit of scale.\\n\\nIt is difficult to scale operations like this, but they already have a manufacturing footprint.\\n\\nThe key is, can they beat the market with a lot of these other competitors as well?\\n\\nThe question I have to you is would you buy one for 20 to $30,000?\\n\\nIt's the price tag was a little bit lower.\\n\\nIt's uh, I, I get that it maybe is lower than what the initial expectations were, but still a lot of money to spend.\\n\\nAnd I think without, with, with, given the fact that there's so much uncertainty, maybe getting people to buy until they really see the payoffs.\\n\\nI feel like you would go out on the limb, maybe potentially purchase one.\\n\\nI mean, I would try it.\\n\\nBut just if you've seen these robots like having something like that in your house, it's a bit of a leap, right?\\n\\nIt is something to have your smartphone, but to have, you know, a piece of metal walking in your house, a whole another composition.\\n\\nBut we'll see, we'll see.\\n\\nCertainly a lot of people excited about like Elon Musk said they could be your friend.\\n\\nThey did look cute for showing the video right now of them dancing up there.\\n\\nBut again, this will certainly be an interesting story to say the least to watch Akiko.\\n\\nWell, they may be flashy but Wall Street doesn't seem to be wowed by Elon Musk's plans for the company at least right now joining us now is Tesla shareholder and Hamilton Capital partners, Chief Investment Officer Alonzo Munoz Alonso.\\n\\nIt's great to have you here and we say the street doesn't seem to be too loud because the stock price is off just over 7% today.\\n\\nI know you've been a shareholder for just about a year.\\n\\nWhat's your quick reaction to what we heard last night?\\n\\nUh, incredible dancing by those robots last night.\\n\\nIt was fun to watch.\\n\\nIt was very futuristic and we've seen some of the negative headlines today.\\n\\nUh, so we're just gonna have to wait and see.\\n\\nI think that analyst and Elon Musk are gonna have an opportunity to really hash this out on the earnings call coming up in the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nAnd that's something that uh that we're gonna be watching out for is the next cat catalyst Alonso.\\n\\nDo you think then that the selling that we're seeing today, is this a bit of an overreaction?\\n\\nI would say?\\n\\nSo, I mean, Elon talked about the implementation of autonomous driving in the model three and the model Y so that would be interesting to see if consumers have a higher take rate on that software.\\n\\nAnd that, that's something that could certainly drive revenue.\\n\\nUh But certainly, I think in overreaction, we, you know, in some ways expected this, the bar was set so so high, but it was a really cool event.\\n\\nUh I think everybody would agree with that.\\n\\nSome really futuristic uh cool looking things, robots were serving drinks.\\n\\nI mean, it was uh it reminded me of the movie I Robot with Will Smith back in the day.\\n\\nSo it's interesting though because some of the uh I guess bears out there on Tesla or just the skeptics have noted that there wasn't a lot of detail on the full self driving vehicles and full self driving technology.\\n\\nRather Goldman specifically talking about the lack of details.\\n\\nI mean, we were more focused on how do they bring this out to their Tesla fleet that they have on the road right now.\\n\\nAnd I think we got a little bit of indication uh last night that this could be active in Texas and in California in their model three and model Y uh but also in their other uh Tesla vehicles, we also saw some broad lineup, right?\\n\\nThe uh what they called the Robo uh the Cyber cab.\\n\\nAnd so, you know, it's, it's something that we're gonna keep an eye out for, but we're really focused on Tesla's vehicle business.\\n\\nThey have, you know, different lines of uh of business like their solar and energy.\\n\\nAnd so we're still excited about the long term prospects.\\n\\nAlonso, there's lots of questions about that cheaper vehicle and how critical that is in order to boosting demand and the fact that uh that it might not happen now for some time, I, I think that could be a worrisome factor here for the street.\\n\\nI, is that something that maybe you think is also a bit of an overreaction to or, or, I guess, why aren't you too concerned?\\n\\nWell, I think so too.\\n\\nI mean, in the macro environment that we're in, we saw consumer confidence this morning, came in a little bit lower and uh interest rates are still high.\\n\\nAnd so the affordability is a big question that I think analysts are mulling over.\\n\\nAnd when we look about vehicles, it's a major pur purchase for the consumer, whether it's their house or their vehicle, it's one of the highest uh highest costs.\\n\\nAnd so I think it would be small for Tesla to roll out a uh lower entry level vehicle at a lower price point.\\n\\nAnd uh as they look to continue to take market share, so it's something that we're looking out for.\\n\\nBut again, you know, we are excited to hear that uh autonomous driving in the form of full self driving software is coming to their fleet and that consumers will hopefully be able to access that in the next year.\\n\\nAlonso, if we can, I want to pull up a chart here, taking a look at the two year performance of a company like GM when compared with Tesla.\\n\\nThanks guys, you can see Tesla under pressure in comparison with a more traditional name like GM.\\n\\nAnd we know that uh, the GM has been outperforming its competitors more broadly but still that is kind of a substantial spread between the two.\\n\\nDo you think that's indicative of a broader challenge for Tesla that some of the more traditional auto makers are becoming some of their biggest competitors?\\n\\nWell, absolutely.\\n\\nAnd Tesla's in a whole different ballpark, I mean, uh, separate from legacy automakers, they're making electric vehicles specifically, they're not making hybrids and they're not making uh gas powered vehicles.\\n\\nSo, you know, it's a challenge.\\n\\nI think that both the macro environment rates being high, the consumer holding on to their, you know, uh holding on to their wall and, but also the adoption of electric vehicles across the globe.\\n\\nAnd again, it's been a challenging uh couple of years for the auto sector, you've seen uh some divergence in different companies.\\n\\nBut for Tesla, we see it also as an energy company, as a software company and the bar is set really high.\\n\\nI mean, it's baked into its multiple and on a day like today, it's an opportunity for investors that want that exposure to that technology, to electric vehicles, to robotics and automation uh to potentially get in at, at uh maybe not, maybe not a discount but at a lower share price.\\n\\nComing up after the break here, we're speaking to an analyst on what Tesla's robot tax.\\n\\nThe event could mean for ride share companies stick with us for that.\\n\\nTesla's highly anticipated Robo taxi event leaving the street disappointed.\\n\\nWe've got the stock selling off as a result shares earlier this morning.\\n\\nWe're off the most that we've seen since August and as the EV giant makes its re emergence or its emergence in the ride hailing industry, we're taking a look at what this ultimately means for some of the that are already within the sector.\\n\\nUber and Lyft, you're seeing shares of both Uber and Lyft moving to the upside here this morning.\\n\\nSo let's talk about why we want to bring in Roth MKM, managing director Rohit Kulkarni Rohit, it's great to have you here.\\n\\nSo we're seeing gains in both Uber and Lyft.\\n\\nWhat is this a result of, is it just simply the fact that the event last night was very lit on details and now investors aren't necessarily seeing Tesla as a threat to these two names?\\n\\nUm Given this raises the kind of long term terminal value of these companies at some point.\\n\\nIf Robotaxis in the next 35, 10 years are going to account for a significant percentage of mobility, then what happens to companies like Uber and Lyft?\\n\\nThat's been a question that's been getting louder and louder over the last uh 3 to 6 months.\\n\\nAnd I think uh given uh Tesla and what uh mask could be capable of doing.\\n\\nThat became a pretty front and center uh uh investor debate.\\n\\nI think given what people saw yesterday, I feel uh it was a big, big relief and essentially reiteration that creating a scale of Robo taxi business is not easy.\\n\\nIt's going to be uh time consuming, resource consuming and uh uh in the meanwhile, the only other two games in town are Uber and Lyft.\\n\\nSo I think that it reinforces that uh Robotaxis.\\n\\nYes, that's a very, very um shiny future, but it's much, much farther along.\\n\\nSo, so then if, if that's a story for a later date, Rohe is something like Waymo, perhaps a bigger competitor to names like Uber and Lyft more immediately.\\n\\nUh Yes, I think uh Google's WEMO has been taking a more practical uh strides with both the technical as well as regulatory sides of things.\\n\\nSo they have been working on this for many more years than what Tesla has been working on.\\n\\nAnd they have proven out uh what uh uh a robot taxi business could look like as far as profitability is concerned, it still is a very, very distant future um possibility.\\n\\nBut I think in the near term, the feasibility and the regulatory check boxes are there.\\n\\nUh Uber has partnered with way more uh because at the end of the day, getting this uh product in front of consumers is also a big cost for some of these companies.\\n\\nSo that, that's one somewhat of a hedge that Uber has.\\n\\nBut I feel uh given uh Tesla is a big, big player, a potential big player is now off the table.\\n\\nThat's the relief rally that you're seeing in Uber and Lyft Roge when we're obviously seeing a bit of a relief rally here in these names today and it clearly is a catalyst at, at least for now.\\n\\nBut looking down the line, are, are you confident that maybe the optimism that we're seeing play out in the market today that that's going to carry through?\\n\\nAnd I guess what do you see as the next big catalyst for either of these names?\\n\\nI think uh in terms of the way these companies are evolving from going only in mobility or maybe last mile delivery, they are becoming what most of the internet marketplaces had taken as the next step, which is advertising and subscription.\\n\\nSo Amazon is the, is the playbook that almost everybody likes to copy and envies a lot.\\n\\nUh They built out a simple ecommerce website, then they built a market place, then they build cloud and then they built advertising.\\n\\nSo that's advertising is the next step in all these uh companies evolution which helps them in two different ways.\\n\\nOne is uh it attracts a different category of customers and it is much more profitable than mobility or ride sharing itself.\\n\\nSo I think next year's story in terms of positive surprises from a cash flow or a profitability standpoint is going to come from, advertising is going to come from subscriptions where these become habituated.\\n\\nAnd, and the longer term thesis here is um look at how many teenagers or people in their twenties are not buying a car anymore.\\n\\nAnd that as that generation goes through their peak buying uh uh kind of days, I feel uh Uber and Lyft stand to benefit a lot.\\n\\nBut that's, that's probably the medium term.\\n\\nBut near term is advertising subscriptions, medium term is that generation uh trying to spend more Rohit.\\n\\nI'm fascinated by that.\\n\\nI thought that was just a thing here in New York City and that was my east coast bias.\\n\\nIs that a broader trend that we're seeing across the country, young people, not purchasing cars and instead just using rideshare services.\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nThink about a kid who was in middle school when the first iphone came out, think about what their behavior and consumer, their kind of usage patterns are evolving to be.\\n\\nIt's very, very unlikely that they are going to be essentially buying a car and getting even when you look at the number of people who have a license when they, they turn 17 years old or 18 years old, that proportion has been declining steadily over the last several years.\\n\\nAnd, and if you just draw that out further, how that translates into buying a car and actually um uh using that as your primary modes of transportation, I think uh uh Uber and Lyft are the, are the big winners there.\\n\\nSo yes, it is not just a big city, New York phenomenon, but it is starting to slowly expand in various parts of us, probably more in Europe as well, which is a structural positive for these companies.\\n\\nThe NASDAQ reversing its earlier moves to the downside up about 4/10 of a percent.\\n\\nYou've got big gains on the S and P up about 7/10 of a percent here in the dow continuing to move to the upside as well.\\n\\nLet's get a closer look at the market action with Yahoo Finance is Jared over at the big big Hey Jared.\\n\\nThank you, Ma I am looking at some Eastern stocks today and markets.\\n\\nLet's put it pull up the wifi Interactive and we can see a little bit of red.\\n\\nAlthough we're seeing a lot of green towards the left here.\\n\\nIt was another negative day in China, although Hong Kong, it looks like it was up about 3%.\\n\\nWe peaked Tuesday and then it was just all downhill.\\n\\nAnd in fact, the regular market, there, some markets were open, but regular markets were closed for about a week for the golden week.\\n\\nAnd this is a time when they kind of regroup, there were stimulus measures announced last weekend and those a negative effect on the market, we just didn't see a very good reaction to that and that's evidenced here, let me show you the year to date chart and you're going to see what I mean, big, big jump, but we've come down appreciably from those highs and I can show you a longer term chart in another Chinese market, which is the Shanghai Shanghai Stock Exchange and this is actually up 18% over the last month.\\n\\nBut if I show you a 20 year chart, you're going to see how the market has basically done nothing over the last five plus years.\\n\\nAnd it is just in a big trading range.\\n\\nYou can see that when you pull up the five year here.\\n\\nSo we're just in the middle treading water doesn't mean a whole lot to price action.\\n\\nYou've got to break out of this and in that regard, there's going to be a meeting tomorrow at least an announcement, 10 a.m. local time.\\n\\nThis is going to be among the head and the Finance Ministry.\\n\\nIt's a joint working group and the authorities there are expected to announce fiscal stimulus measures.\\n\\nThey have already done about half a trillion dollars in fiscal and monetary.\\n\\nAnd this observation comes from Macro elf that when we had that big 2008 crisis, the global financial crisis, that response was 20 trillion y that was short of three trillion.\\n\\nAll right, we're not even talking about one trillion today.\\n\\nAnd I think that accounts for some of the disappointment and it's going to be really interesting to see what the magic number is that actually gets things to open in the green on Monday if they can guys.\\n\\nAll right, Jared, thanks so much for breaking that down for us there.\\n\\nComing up, we're gonna take a closer look at Nike and analyst out covering Nike talking about the potential catalysts for the companies moving forward.\\n\\nLong time, Nike veteran Elliot Hill taken over the CEO C on Monday.\\n\\nOur next guest sees the leadership change is a potential catalyst for growth for the company, upgrading the stock to buy rating from hold.\\n\\nJoining us.\\n\\nNow, the analyst behind that called, you got joke from truest here, Joe is great to have you on.\\n\\nSo talk to me about why the CEO change is a bullish signal to you.\\n\\nAnd, um, to be honest, through that period, a lot of people have been expecting, you know, a turnaround to come up soon.\\n\\nThey've been looking at it, you know, the stock and think about, oh, this is an incredible brand.\\n\\nUm, but we've seen some, some downside here sluggish innovation, et cetera.\\n\\nA few things have gone wrong, but they've been expecting a turnaround.\\n\\nIt hasn't happened, Mr Hill taking, you know, taking the helm.\\n\\nUh I think he's a tenured industry vet, he knows the company well, he knows their partners, he knows the customers.\\n\\nI think, you know, he can come in and, you know, make some changes, really refresh the, the business and uh do things that investors want to see.\\n\\nAnd with that, I think, you know, we could see a pretty quick sentiment boost, you know, as long as they can handle some of the low hanging fruit that I think people are looking for.\\n\\nHow big of a boost show do you think that will be, uh tonight?\\n\\nYou and I guess, is it enough to overcome some of those product headwinds that we've been talking about for?\\n\\nSo, for so long, I, I think so.\\n\\nUm, so like I said, over the past year, it seems like people were to me overly bullish on a quick turnaround or, you know, things improving in a more rapid pace.\\n\\nUh This is a big business and this is the industry has long lead times, things take time.\\n\\nI think we've finally gotten to a point where expectations are low enough, realistic enough to encapsulate that.\\n\\nSo I think, you know, signs of, you know, better times ahead, brighter outlook will be enough to boost sentiment enough to offset, you know, near term earnings pressure that you might see from more aggressive marketing investing in the right areas.\\n\\nThings like that.\\n\\nIt's interesting because I know that Nike has been struggling for quite some time now on a variety of issues.\\n\\nBut one of them is the challenges related to the consumer slowdown in China specifically, I guess I wonder to what extent A CEO is able to control or turn that story around?\\n\\nYeah, I mean, in China, they've been facing a combination of macro pressures and you know, we think that other brands but whether it be, you know, local Chinese brands or Western brands are also, you know, building out their footprints in China.\\n\\nSo they've clearly seen a lot of issues there.\\n\\nUm and I acknowledge that what I would say is, you know, they gave a lot of color on the recent call about pressures that they have there.\\n\\nSo I just think a lot of that is embedded in the stock um at this valuation and Joe I'm also interested in the relation wholesalers and we've seen other competitors in the space like an on holdings, for example, really cutting out the middleman and finding success with direct to consumer.\\n\\nTo what extent do you see that as sort of a requirement for Nike to continue to grow here?\\n\\nI couldn't fully hear your question.\\n\\nUh I was cutting out a little bit but um I think I heard most of it and I would say that, you know, from here, what I want to see is Nike focusing more in the wholesale channel at this point.\\n\\nI think they need to get back to the distribution points that, you know, people are shopping in because I think, you know, people have wanted to get Nikes but weren't able to find them in the venues that they're, they're looking for them in.\\n\\nUm You could, you know, maybe at a point in time, we would have thought there would have been a lot more growth on the B to C channel.\\n\\nPeople would have been flocking to Nike's website app.\\n\\nThat's kind of what was expected a few years ago.\\n\\nIt didn't really pan out exactly like that and I'm not saying that they can't eventually grow with that again.\\n\\nBut right now, I think the focus should be on meeting the consumer where they are rather than trying to draw them to your own channel.\\n\\nWe appreciate you giving us some insight ahead of the CEO change that's happening and taking effect next week coming up right after the break.\\n\\nWe're gonna be taking a closer look at NVIDIA, NVIDIA hovering and not too far from record highs.\\n\\nWe've got more on that next now, time for more of today's trending tickers skin, the QR code below to track the best and the worst performing stocks of the session with Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page.\\n\\nWe want to take a look at NVIDIA and video.\\n\\nOne of the most AAPT, uh searched stocks here at Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nToday, we're looking at a bit of a move lower but the story all week has been the fact that we're very close to those record highs given the fact that we've seen this continued excitement around the A boom.\\n\\nAnalysts reiterating their buy ratings on the stock, citing revenue from its new Blackwell chips and new funding for A I start ups.\\n\\nThe stock also getting a boost after a Taiwan semiconductor, which is one of its manufacturers reported better than expected sales.\\n\\nSo exactly what maybe this ultimately means here for demand down the line that has of course been the driving factor for NVIDIA.\\n\\nI think the question is any sort of um the fact that it could maybe not live up to those initial expectations on Blackwell that had been a bit of a headwind or a challenge here that analysts have been talking about now for quite some time.\\n\\nBut that narrative has certainly shifted.\\n\\nWe've heard from Co Jensen Wong reiterating time and time again that he's very confident in the demand there, he quote unquote called it insane demand for Blackwell chips.\\n\\nAnd that was enough to get any of those or seems to at least for now convince any of those naysayers that Nvidia's momentum still looks like it will continue here to the upside mad.\\n\\nI mean, it's interesting given just the degree of movement that NVIDIA causes to globally, I know we talk about this all the time, but I've got a note in front of me here noting that NVIDIA represents 15% of global equity volatility that is in every stock market in the entire world.\\n\\nEvery major index.\\n\\nNVIDIA alone is responsible for 15% of global volatility.\\n\\nAlso, you mentioned time on semiconductor, uh NVIDIA has been responsible for about 25% of the market gains here in the United States a year to date.\\n\\nBut you can see again that global impact, right TSM CS gains obviously continuing to move to the upside off of that revenue that we talked about earlier this week.\\n\\nUh Time on semiconductor is responsible for 75% of the year to date rally in Taiwan's index.\\n\\nSo just giving some examples of how just Nvidia's growth story continues to be huge, not only here in the United States, but also more broadly.\\n\\nAnd NVIDIA really the clear A I beneficiary.\\n\\nThat's what Goldman Sachs is calling it as of yesterday here over at their equities team saying that growing growth, growth can continue to be expected into what they call A I phase two multiples.\\n\\nBut they still recommend being selective within some of those A I stocks.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nWell, Invidia backed core Weve is securing a new $650 million credit line GP U A cloud provider is planning to use that credit to expand its business and data center portfolio.\\n\\nNow, the company is raising nearly $13 billion from equity and debt in the past 18 months.\\n\\nAnd I just want to take a look here because again that $650 million credit line, it's coming from the top banks on Wall Street, right?\\n\\nSo a key indication of some optimism around it.\\n\\nI'm talking JP Morgan, Goldman, Sachs Morgan Stanley leading the financing, but we also had participation from Barclays Wells Fargo City and some others as well.\\n\\nNow, just to speak specifically about co we, the company saying it's raised over $12.7 billion from equity and debt investors in just the last 18 months.\\n\\nSo certainly a lot of optimism around this name following funding round back in May which led to a $19 billion valuation as well.\\n\\nYou might be actually asking yourself maybe why NIA has taken a stake within this need name or investing backing a name like we in the past and it may and uh almost almost solidifies their dominance there going forward, making sure that their technology continues to be deployed and widely used.\\n\\nUh when it comes to some of the ambitions here from Cory, they have been very ambitious 28 data centers across the US and here abroad, they plan to build another 10 data centers when you look ahead to 2025 has supplied Microsoft and the French data mistral with, with GP US in the past.\\n\\nSo questions about maybe what that revenue and what their business look like that reportedly right around $2 billion in revenue contracts lined up for this year.\\n\\nSo again, this backing and further expansion plans may be ahead for core weave and just given the chat that we were just having on NVIDIA.\\n\\nAnd so many of these A I means clearly that appetite and that demand for A I is not going anywhere anytime soon.\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nAnd it's certainly driving the markets here as we head to that two year anniversary of the bull market.\\n\\nBut let's take a look at how markets are shaping up today as we head into our 11 a.m. hour here.\\n\\nYou've got green across your screen, the nada paying back some of its earlier games but still continuing to move to the upside, the S and P 500 up about 5/10 of a percent.\\n\\nThe biggest gain or sector wise today.\\n\\nFinancials, no surprise coming off the heels of those bank earnings of about 1.9%.\\n\\nInteresting to know that the biggest drag on the S and P at this time is tech.\\n\\nAnd it's interesting to see that given what we have been talking about here to the rally more broadly, we're seeing weakness in Broadcom sales force and IBM, those are the biggest market cap and waited names on the S and P that are driving down the tech sector right now.\\n\\nSo interesting to see some of that weakness particularly in a chip name like broad come here.\\n\\nBut we will continue to monitor that movement and more for you throughout the day here at Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nBut coming up, we've got wealth that's dedicated to all of your personal finance needs that has a year for the next hour.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"British Airways cancels hundreds of flights because of Rolls-Royce engine issues\\n\\nChris Price\\n\\n11 October 2024 at 8:27 pm\\n\\nBritish Airways scrapped hundreds of long-haul flights as maintenance issues with its Rolls-Royce jet engines grounded aircraft.\\n\\nThe carrier has halted the launch of services to Malaysia, halved frequencies to Qatar and suspended services between Gatwick airport and New York JFK - affecting travel plans for thousands of people.\\n\\nBA said it was forced into the measures because of excessive wear and tear to the Trent 1000 engines that power its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets.\\n\\nRolls-Royce has been unable to supply enough replacement engines and parts to keep all of the 787s flying, leading five to be grounded. This equates to 15pc of the fleet.\\n\\nBoeing 777s, which had been standing in for the stricken planes, have also been overworked to such an extent that they too require visits to the workshop.\\n\\nA BA spokesperson said: \\\"We've taken this action because we do not believe the issue will be solved quickly, and we want to offer our customers the certainty they deserve\\n\\n\\\"We've apologised to those affected and are able to offer the vast majority a flight the same day with British Airways or one of our partner airlines.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to work closely with Rolls-Royce to ensure the company is aware of the impact its issues are having on our schedule and customers, and seek reassurance of a prompt and reliable solution.\\\"\\n\\nBA said the launch of a new Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur route will be delayed from November to April next year.\\n\\nOne of two daily trips from Heathrow to Doha will be scrapped until March, while flights from Gatwick to JFK will be suspended from early December for the whole of the winter season.\\n\\nBA warned there will also be a number of cancellations on other long-haul routes between now and January.\\n\\nIt said the bulk of passengers affected will be accommodated on its own flights, including eight daily services from Heathrow to New York, or with partners including Qatar Airways.\\n\\nThe carrier had already scrapped 11 round-trip services due to the Rolls-Royce issues. It is understood that the situation has been exacerbated by a strike over pay at Boeing, which has held up supplies of some other parts.\\n\\nBA has started to contact customers whose flights have been cancelled to offer alternative travel arrangements and laying the blame squarely at the door of Rolls.\\n\\n\\\"Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges,\\\" it said.\\n\\n\\\"We're not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation.\\\"\\n\\nA Rolls-Royce spokesman said: \\\"We continue to work with British Airways and all of our customers to minimise the impact of the limited availability of spares due to the current supply chain constraints. Unfortunately, this is an issue affecting the whole aerospace industry.\\\"\\n\\nRead the latest updates below.\\n\\n06:22 PM BST\\n\\nSigning off...\\n\\nThanks for joining us today.\\n\\nWe will be back on the Markets blog on Monday morning but do keep up with all our latest business news, analysis and comment over the weekend here.\\n\\n06:04 PM BST\\n\\nUS banking giants say consumers still spending\\n\\nAmerican consumers remain resilient and are continuing to spending, two of the country's biggest lenders said on Friday.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum, chief financial officer of JPMorgan, said:\\n\\nOverall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid. [They are] consistent with the narrative that consumers are on solid footing and consistent with a strong labour market and the current central case of a kind of 'no-landing' scenario economically.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Michael Santomassimo, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo chief financial officer, said spending on credit and debit cards, while down a little from earlier this year, was still \\\"quite solid.\\\"\\n\\nThe market will get a fuller picture when Bank of America and Citigroup, the country's other two major consumer banks, report next week and retail sales data is released. Several investors said Friday's earnings were so far a positive sign.\\n\\nTaylor Krystkowiak, at invesment firm Themes ETFs, said:\\n\\nThe fact that ... not only are we averting a hard landing, there might even be a chance that there's no landing, and that we're able to continue to push forward is definitely going to be a big windfall for banks.\\n\\nStill, Mr Santomassimo warned that the cumulative impact of higher inflation was stretching lower-income consumers and the bank was watching to see if that pattern spread to higher income customers.\\n\\n05:57 PM BST\\n\\nUber shares jump in response to unveiling of Tesla's robotaxi\\n\\nShares in ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft were both up about 10pc today, as analysts said the lack of details on Tesla's robotaxis eased competition worries for the companies.\\n\\nLast night electronic dance music-infused event run by Elon Musk failed to impress shareholders. Some investors and experts said they were hoping for more concrete details on how the company plans to transform from an automaker into an autonomous driving and artificial intelligence titan with a solid business plan.\\n\\nTesla shares fell nearly 8pc in Friday trading. The stock, which has been pummeled in recent years by fears of cheaper EV rivals eating into Tesla's market share, is up nearly 50pc since April when Musk announced the shift to robotaxis. Still, shares are down 8pc over the last year, compared with a 33pc increase in the broad-market S&P 500 index.\\n\\nRoss Gerber, a Tesla shareholder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said:\\n\\nHis vision is lovely, but somebody has to actualise it. For now, for the next 24 months, Tesla has to sell EVs.

Ltd., Spectrum Geophysics, TGS NOPEC Geophysical Co ASA, Weatherford International Plc, and Xcalibur Multiphysics\\n\\nMarket Driver\\n\\nGeophysical services play a crucial role in identifying mineral reserves through seismic techniques. Traditional methods involve transmitting seismic waves into the Earth's surface using a geophone connected to a specialized truck. Schlumberger and ExxonMobil are leading vendors offering 4D seismic solutions, which improve image quality by monitoring changes in hydrocarbon reservoirs over time using multiple surveys and time-lapse technology. The Gulf of Mexico has seen a joint venture between CGG and Fugro for 4D ocean bottom seismic monitoring. The adoption of 4D seismic techniques is increasing due to the rise in oil and gas exploration projects, enhancing the efficiency of extraction processes. These companies leverage 4D seismic solutions to provide high-definition seismic changes, aiding in better identification and extraction paths for hydrocarbon reservoirs.\\n\\nThe Geophysical Services Market is experiencing significant growth, particularly in sectors like Natural Gas Production and Oil & Gas Industry. However, regulatory impediments, environmental regulations, land access permissions, safety standards, and ecosystem preservation pose challenges.

      "    \"body\": \"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation.\\n\\nThe presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum.\\n\\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37, and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked No.\\n\\n1 in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year on year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm wide results.\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in JPMorgan Chase, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and JPMorgan Chase wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\\n\\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $826,130!*\\n\\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\\n\\nThe firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year on year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year on year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year on year, driven by compensation including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.\\n\\nAnd credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card, and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.\\n\\nThis quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year on year.\\n\\nIn Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year on year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year on year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network.\\n\\nIn-home lending, revenue was up 3% year on year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year on year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.\\n\\nAnd in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year on year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year on year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5.\\n\\nThe CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals.\\n\\nUnderwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year on year.\\n\\nFixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year on year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.\\n\\nExpenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year on year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation, and growth in place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity.\\n\\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year on year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%.\\n\\nFor the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year on year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed-income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion.\\n\\nAUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion.\\n\\nRevenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year on year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year on year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year on year.\\n\\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on Page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth-quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense.\\n\\nAnd note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues.\\n\\nBut we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\\n\\nThank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\\n\\nJim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question.\\n\\nI realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for '25? Thanks.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve.\\n\\nSo that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit.\\n\\nSo that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.\\n\\nAnd then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter.\\n\\nAnd as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth.\\n\\nObviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\\n\\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Good morning. So, Jeremy, hi. How are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light.\\n\\nI believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment.\\n\\nJust want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion.\\n\\nSo that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation.\\n\\nBut, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year.\\n\\nAnd so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed.\\n\\nThe strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management.\\n\\nWe're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that.\\n\\nOur goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things.\\n\\nAnd also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time.\\n\\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\\n\\nNo. Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities.\\n\\nWe saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers.\\n\\nYeah. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower.\\n\\nIt'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could.\\n\\nWe have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.\\n\\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\\n\\nWell said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.\\n\\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nMy first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year over year in '25, consensus has it down 4% from your new level.\\n\\nSo it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year over year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness, or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nRight, OK. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question.\\n\\nSo we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year.\\n\\nSo you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth-quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.\\n\\nSo you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now --\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nCould I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth.\\n\\nAnd there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nGood. OK. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there.\\n\\nSo as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact.\\n\\nAnd then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front-end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end.\\n\\nSo therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can ask my second question and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business.\\n\\nAnd again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that.\\n\\nSo our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, etc. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital.\\n\\nAnd for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.\\n\\nWe will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.\\n\\nThe most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine.\\n\\nAnd so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.\\n\\nAnd one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\\n\\nGlenn Schorr -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers.\\n\\nWe've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed-income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side.\\n\\nYeah. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical.\\n\\nI think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.\\n\\nDirect lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid off, some are done.\\n\\nSo we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size.\\n\\nWe're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy.\\n\\nWe're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider.\\n\\nThat's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different.\\n\\nThat's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship.\\n\\nSo we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as vice chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr's speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital.\\n\\nIn my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nBut Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff.\\n\\nAnd so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed.\\n\\nSo we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are.\\n\\nCan you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product.\\n\\nI would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nI would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those.\\n\\nSo it's possible that that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi, and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected.\\n\\nSo I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year over year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSo I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever.\\n\\nSo you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.\\n\\nSo overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios.\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\\n\\nMike Mayo -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2nd, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed.\\n\\nYour bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy.\\n\\nSo -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job.\\n\\nMike Mayo -- Analyst\\n\\nSo if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I'm not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do.\\n\\nI intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.\\n\\nMike Mayo -- Analyst\\n\\nLet me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued.\\n\\nAnd on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it.\\n\\nWe haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices.\\n\\nAnd I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.\\n\\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending.\\n\\nAnother area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed-income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nEbrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech's. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.\\n\\nNow those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors.\\n\\nYou've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S.\\n\\ncapital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied.\\n\\nBut in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nCan I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well-positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers, and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet.\\n\\nBut we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit.\\n\\nBut again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it.\\n\\nWe're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that.\\n\\nGot it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September.\\n\\nJust give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago.\\n\\nYou don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a systemwide deposit growth, which gets removed.\\n\\nAnd that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan.\\n\\nIt's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time.\\n\\nI think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again.\\n\\nI can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\n\\nYes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it.\\n\\nBut when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point.\\n\\nYou also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR.\\n\\nBut for the [Inaudible] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you --\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThose were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year on year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion.\\n\\nAnd as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions.\\n\\nI realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.\\n\\n-- creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that.\\n\\nBut put us in a cautious category and credit card by the way, we are -- we don't like stretch.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nI'm just wondering about the private-label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAlmost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label.\\n\\nI know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible.\\n\\nSo I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance.\\n\\nThank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.\\n\\nSaul Martinez -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going.\\n\\nSo I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already.\\n\\nJust for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high.\\n\\nAnd that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy.\\n\\nWe were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective.\\n\\nWe think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression.\\n\\nAnd then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nJeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%.\\n\\nOK. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nVery good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time.\\n\\nWe're very comfortable, very nice business for you all.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nGot it. OK, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.\\n\\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please note that Page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 profitability and unit metrics, consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express (NYSE:AXP) co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan.\\n\\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus (EPA:AIR) aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please go to the first analyst question?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating out that impact from what you're seeing internally? And maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just, Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic capacity kind of going forward, lower cost airlines cutting capacity? Does that make you think about share any differently here?\\n\\nEd Bastian: Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Thanks and good morning, everyone. A couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are culled provide the greatest uplift to RASM and from there RASM benefits still accrue over time, but at sort of a declining rate of improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded or is the reality of something different?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts?\\n\\nJamie Baker: The latter, the beneficiary, so Delta in this case.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery you're thinking about for 2025? But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, hypothetically, I'm not arguing that this would happen. But if we saw a full restoration to where corporate trends would be had COVID not occurred would you need to rebalance the network much or would it simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in the fourth quarter by entities and just the kind of the trends beyond the elections?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the -- follow-up on the Hurricane Helene impact. You called out, the impact of $0.03. I know it's really early days. I was just kind of curious if you have kind of the impact of Hurricane Milton in your guidance and how you're thinking about it?\\n\\nEd Bastian: It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, Glen. I recall -- I want to say this was either the last conference call or maybe it was a conference where I think you were asked about where organic demand was relative to the fact that we were seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional - driven by promotions and then our organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you talk about in the comments in your script, you talked about domestic where it seems like supply and demand are now in sync. And if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%. Are you sort of indicating that maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you just - some additional color on that?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, I think, on the distribution front, it does look like you've -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs. And I know that you've been moving more into sort of the -- on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about that, your cost of distribution. Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my question.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how aggressive do you like pretend -- like thinking -- or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others, like, you're already deepening your moat like in real time. I'm just trying to understand how deep it is or how deep you can get it from here? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that.\\n\\nDan Janki: I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then we're starting to hear a little bit more or see the products that the domestic leisure carriers are offering. And when you look at Delta Comfort+ in that offering and compare it to what the industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of to widen that gap to the new products that are already out there or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at.\\n\\nDan Janki: Coming out theme today.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we've been out on this for years. And so we'll continue on the pace we're on. We're not going to change course. If anything, we're just going to continue to accelerate.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: See you in a month. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of or a bit of noise right now in the baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so I wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side, and was there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then just -- thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that one, going forward. What inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metrics should we be watching on that front? Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on.\\n\\nEd Bastian: And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. Appreciate the thoughts.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like, is October in your view of December, right, if we eliminate the November and the elections, are October and December positive on unit revenue?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November.\\n\\nScott Group: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about for CASM next year? I know we'll get probably more of a guide at the Analyst Day, but just directionally just puts and takes to be thinking about?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. I'd say building off of - thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we're going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You're going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you're going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You've got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know - we put the incremental investment in, we'll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we're built for it.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer, so maybe I'll try to provide a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer schedule next year. I think you even have a news article saying flights could be up high-single digit levels. Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too much away?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Really appreciate that, Glen. And then, Dan, maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I mean does this have broader implications for your airport costs because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures here on the industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage.\\n\\nEd Bastian: The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast-follower on?\\n\\nEd Bastian: This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. And then just if I may, a quick modeling question. Does your fuel guide include a refinery -- or assume a refinery benefit or a refinery headwind? Thanks again for the time everyone.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now, looking at 1Q capacity, how do you feel about that? And do you feel like it's in a good spot or maybe there's more to come out or kind of how does that evolve?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And maybe just a follow-up for Dan. Congrats on the investment grade here. Obviously, kind of big change from the pandemic time. Where does that lead the balance sheet kind of going into '25 and how do you think about continued debt paydown versus cash return?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Lots went back next month looking forward to it\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, it's outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up or does premium have more to go?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year is that those incremental cuts -- capacity cuts come into play. So I would assume that main cabin, as we exit this year, is starting to improve on the margin. But we also think there's more to go on the premium products. And I think not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day. But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes. I agree with both.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications of the benefit in the main cabin catch-up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as we head into '25 or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Your line is live.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month, and we think about the long-term free cash flow generation potential at Delta. Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen. Just from transatlantic commentary seems very positive. It seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive over -- from what we can see in schedules. How would you rank the potential for transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head into 2025? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everyone and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with -- in equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative solutions across your business? Thank you.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November and thank you very much for the time.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we could repeat the instructions and for the call queue, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season, you mentioned, Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August because of the weather changes. And then, I also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've been investing a lot, obviously, the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What are you thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are some of the features that customers are asking for that maybe you're not offering now or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. I thought you mentioned talking about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like a permanent shift.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what's your thinking there, especially for the [Multiple Speakers]?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\\n\\nAlison Sider: Thanks so much. Curious, I had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious, what you're seeing in New York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there?\\n\\nPeter Carter: Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this. And what I would say is that the N90s shift seems to have gone well, but we still have the same constraints in the New York aerospace that we've had for the last couple of years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers. And I think the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that, but it's going to take some time.\\n\\nAlison Sider: And is New York kind of still the major -- that airspace is kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like, how much does that ripple out to the rest of the country?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding of the core hubs and you made a reference to getting all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what happened with your regional feed since the pandemic and how that like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Certainly, as you know, pilot constraints as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period put a lot of strain on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them and we've been working very closely with them. And now that the industry growth are patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more normalized pilot hiring across the industry. The dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is dissipating very quickly. And so, in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. Most recently, this past year, it's been more like 65% to 70%. And by next summer, we think that will be back to 100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Mary. Matthew, that will wrap us up on the media questions, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you again in January. I think many of you next month at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.\",\n",

      "    \"title\": \"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool\",\n",
      "    \"body\": \"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation.\\n\\nThe presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum.\\n\\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37, and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked No.\\n\\n1 in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year on year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm wide results.\\n\\nThe firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year on year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year on year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year on year, driven by compensation including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.\\n\\nAnd credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card, and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.\\n\\nThis quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year on year.\\n\\nIn Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year on year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year on year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network.\\n\\nIn-home lending, revenue was up 3% year on year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year on year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.\\n\\nAnd in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year on year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year on year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5.\\n\\nThe CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals.\\n\\nUnderwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year on year.\\n\\nFixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year on year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.\\n\\nExpenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year on year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation, and growth in place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity.\\n\\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year on year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%.\\n\\nFor the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year on year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed-income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion.\\n\\nAUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion.\\n\\nRevenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year on year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year on year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year on year.\\n\\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on Page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth-quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense.\\n\\nAnd note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues.\\n\\nBut we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\\n\\nJim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question.\\n\\nI realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for '25? Thanks.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve.\\n\\nSo that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit.\\n\\nSo that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.\\n\\nAnd then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter.\\n\\nAnd as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth.\\n\\nObviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\\n\\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Good morning. So, Jeremy, hi. How are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light.\\n\\nI believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment.\\n\\nJust want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion.\\n\\nSo that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation.\\n\\nBut, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year.\\n\\nAnd so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed.\\n\\nThe strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management.\\n\\nWe're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that.\\n\\nOur goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things.\\n\\nAnd also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time.\\n\\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\\n\\nNo. Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities.\\n\\nWe saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers.\\n\\nYeah. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower.\\n\\nIt'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could.\\n\\nWe have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.\\n\\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\\n\\nWell said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.\\n\\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nMy first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year over year in '25, consensus has it down 4% from your new level.\\n\\nSo it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year over year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness, or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nRight, OK. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question.\\n\\nSo we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year.\\n\\nSo you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth-quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.\\n\\nSo you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now --\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nCould I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth.\\n\\nAnd there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nGood. OK. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there.\\n\\nSo as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact.\\n\\nAnd then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front-end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end.\\n\\nSo therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.\\n\\nErika Najarian -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can ask my second question and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business.\\n\\nAnd again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that.\\n\\nSo our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, etc. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital.\\n\\nAnd for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.\\n\\nWe will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.\\n\\nThe most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine.\\n\\nAnd so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.\\n\\nAnd one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\\n\\nGlenn Schorr -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers.\\n\\nWe've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed-income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side.\\n\\nYeah. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical.\\n\\nI think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.\\n\\nDirect lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid off, some are done.\\n\\nSo we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size.\\n\\nWe're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy.\\n\\nWe're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider.\\n\\nThat's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different.\\n\\nThat's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship.\\n\\nSo we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as vice chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr's speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital.\\n\\nIn my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nBut Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff.\\n\\nAnd so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed.\\n\\nSo we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are.\\n\\nCan you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product.\\n\\nI would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it.\\n\\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nGood morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nI would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those.\\n\\nSo it's possible that that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi, and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected.\\n\\nSo I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year.\\n\\nMatthew O'Connor -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year over year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSo I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever.\\n\\nSo you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.\\n\\nSo overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios.\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\\n\\nMike Mayo -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2nd, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed.\\n\\nYour bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy.\\n\\nSo -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job.\\n\\nMike Mayo -- Analyst\\n\\nSo if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I'm not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do.\\n\\nI intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.\\n\\nMike Mayo -- Analyst\\n\\nLet me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued.\\n\\nAnd on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it.\\n\\nWe haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices.\\n\\nAnd I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.\\n\\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending.\\n\\nAnother area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed-income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nEbrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech's. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.\\n\\nNow those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors.\\n\\nYou've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S.\\n\\ncapital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied.\\n\\nBut in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nCan I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well-positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers, and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet.\\n\\nBut we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit.\\n\\nBut again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it.\\n\\nWe're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that.\\n\\nGot it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September.\\n\\nJust give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago.\\n\\nYou don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a systemwide deposit growth, which gets removed.\\n\\nAnd that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan.\\n\\nIt's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time.\\n\\nI think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again.\\n\\nI can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\n\\nYes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it.\\n\\nBut when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right?\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point.\\n\\nYou also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR.\\n\\nBut for the [Inaudible] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you --\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThose were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year on year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion.\\n\\nAnd as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions.\\n\\nI realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.\\n\\n-- creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that.\\n\\nBut put us in a cautious category and credit card by the way, we are -- we don't like stretch.\\n\\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst\\n\\nI'm just wondering about the private-label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients?\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAlmost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label.\\n\\nI know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible.\\n\\nSo I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance.\\n\\nThank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.\\n\\nSaul Martinez -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going.\\n\\nSo I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already.\\n\\nJust for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high.\\n\\nAnd that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy.\\n\\nWe were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective.\\n\\nWe think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression.\\n\\nAnd then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nJeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%.\\n\\nOK. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels.\\n\\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nVery good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time.\\n\\nWe're very comfortable, very nice business for you all.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nGot it. OK, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.\",\n",

My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please note that Page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 profitability and unit metrics, consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express (NYSE:AXP) co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan.\\n\\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please go to the first analyst question?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating out that impact from what you're seeing internally? And maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just, Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic capacity kind of going forward, lower cost airlines cutting capacity? Does that make you think about share any differently here?\\n\\nEd Bastian: Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Your line is live.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Thanks and good morning, everyone. A couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are culled provide the greatest uplift to RASM and from there RASM benefits still accrue over time, but at sort of a declining rate of improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded or is the reality of something different?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts?\\n\\nJamie Baker: The latter, the beneficiary, so Delta in this case.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery you're thinking about for 2025? But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, hypothetically, I'm not arguing that this would happen. But if we saw a full restoration to where corporate trends would be had COVID not occurred would you need to rebalance the network much or would it simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in the fourth quarter by entities and just the kind of the trends beyond the elections?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the -- follow-up on the Hurricane Helene impact. You called out, the impact of $0.03. I know it's really early days. I was just kind of curious if you have kind of the impact of Hurricane Milton in your guidance and how you're thinking about it?\\n\\nEd Bastian: It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, Glen. I recall -- I want to say this was either the last conference call or maybe it was a conference where I think you were asked about where organic demand was relative to the fact that we were seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional - driven by promotions and then our organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you talk about in the comments in your script, you talked about domestic where it seems like supply and demand are now in sync. And if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%. Are you sort of indicating that maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you just - some additional color on that?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, I think, on the distribution front, it does look like you've -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs. And I know that you've been moving more into sort of the -- on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about that, your cost of distribution. Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my question.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how aggressive do you like pretend -- like thinking -- or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others, like, you're already deepening your moat like in real time. I'm just trying to understand how deep it is or how deep you can get it from here? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that.\\n\\nDan Janki: I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then we're starting to hear a little bit more or see the products that the domestic leisure carriers are offering. And when you look at Delta Comfort+ in that offering and compare it to what the industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of to widen that gap to the new products that are already out there or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at.\\n\\nDan Janki: Coming out theme today.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we've been out on this for years. And so we'll continue on the pace we're on. We're not going to change course. If anything, we're just going to continue to accelerate.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: See you in a month. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of or a bit of noise right now in the baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so I wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side, and was there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then just -- thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that one, going forward. What inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metrics should we be watching on that front? Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on.\\n\\nEd Bastian: And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. Appreciate the thoughts.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like, is October in your view of December, right, if we eliminate the November and the elections, are October and December positive on unit revenue?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November.\\n\\nScott Group: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about for CASM next year? I know we'll get probably more of a guide at the Analyst Day, but just directionally just puts and takes to be thinking about?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. I'd say building off of - thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we're going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You're going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you're going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You've got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know - we put the incremental investment in, we'll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we're built for it.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer, so maybe I'll try to provide a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer schedule next year. I think you even have a news article saying flights could be up high-single digit levels. Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too much away?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Really appreciate that, Glen. And then, Dan, maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I mean does this have broader implications for your airport costs because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures here on the industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage.\\n\\nEd Bastian: The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast-follower on?\\n\\nEd Bastian: This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. And then just if I may, a quick modeling question. Does your fuel guide include a refinery -- or assume a refinery benefit or a refinery headwind? Thanks again for the time everyone.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Your line is live.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now, looking at 1Q capacity, how do you feel about that? And do you feel like it's in a good spot or maybe there's more to come out or kind of how does that evolve?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And maybe just a follow-up for Dan. Congrats on the investment grade here. Obviously, kind of big change from the pandemic time. Where does that lead the balance sheet kind of going into '25 and how do you think about continued debt paydown versus cash return?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Lots went back next month looking forward to it\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, it's outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up or does premium have more to go?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year is that those incremental cuts -- capacity cuts come into play. So I would assume that main cabin, as we exit this year, is starting to improve on the margin. But we also think there's more to go on the premium products. And I think not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day. But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes. I agree with both.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications of the benefit in the main cabin catch-up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as we head into '25 or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Your line is live.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month, and we think about the long-term free cash flow generation potential at Delta. Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen. Just from transatlantic commentary seems very positive. It seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive over -- from what we can see in schedules. How would you rank the potential for transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head into 2025? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everyone and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with -- in equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative solutions across your business? Thank you.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November and thank you very much for the time.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we could repeat the instructions and for the call queue, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season, you mentioned, Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August because of the weather changes. And then, I also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've been investing a lot, obviously, the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What are you thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are some of the features that customers are asking for that maybe you're not offering now or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. I thought you mentioned talking about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like a permanent shift.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what's your thinking there, especially for the [Multiple Speakers]?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\\n\\nAlison Sider: Thanks so much. Curious, I had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious, what you're seeing in New York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there?\\n\\nPeter Carter: Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this. And what I would say is that the N90s shift seems to have gone well, but we still have the same constraints in the New York aerospace that we've had for the last couple of years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers. And I think the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that, but it's going to take some time.\\n\\nAlison Sider: And is New York kind of still the major -- that airspace is kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like, how much does that ripple out to the rest of the country?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding of the core hubs and you made a reference to getting all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what happened with your regional feed since the pandemic and how that like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Certainly, as you know, pilot constraints as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period put a lot of strain on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them and we've been working very closely with them. And now that the industry growth are patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more normalized pilot hiring across the industry. The dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is dissipating very quickly. And so, in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. Most recently, this past year, it's been more like 65% to 70%. And by next summer, we think that will be back to 100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Mary. Matthew, that will wrap us up on the media questions, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you again in January. I think many of you next month at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.\",\n",

My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please note that Page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 profitability and unit metrics, consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express (NYSE:AXP) co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan.\\n\\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please go to the first analyst question?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating out that impact from what you're seeing internally? And maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just, Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic capacity kind of going forward, lower cost airlines cutting capacity? Does that make you think about share any differently here?\\n\\nEd Bastian: Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Your line is live.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Thanks and good morning, everyone. A couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are culled provide the greatest uplift to RASM and from there RASM benefits still accrue over time, but at sort of a declining rate of improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded or is the reality of something different?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts?\\n\\nJamie Baker: The latter, the beneficiary, so Delta in this case.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery you're thinking about for 2025? But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, hypothetically, I'm not arguing that this would happen. But if we saw a full restoration to where corporate trends would be had COVID not occurred would you need to rebalance the network much or would it simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in the fourth quarter by entities and just the kind of the trends beyond the elections?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the -- follow-up on the Hurricane Helene impact. You called out, the impact of $0.03. I know it's really early days. I was just kind of curious if you have kind of the impact of Hurricane Milton in your guidance and how you're thinking about it?\\n\\nEd Bastian: It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, Glen. I recall -- I want to say this was either the last conference call or maybe it was a conference where I think you were asked about where organic demand was relative to the fact that we were seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional - driven by promotions and then our organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you talk about in the comments in your script, you talked about domestic where it seems like supply and demand are now in sync. And if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%. Are you sort of indicating that maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you just - some additional color on that?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, I think, on the distribution front, it does look like you've -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs. And I know that you've been moving more into sort of the -- on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about that, your cost of distribution. Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my question.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how aggressive do you like pretend -- like thinking -- or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others, like, you're already deepening your moat like in real time. I'm just trying to understand how deep it is or how deep you can get it from here? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that.\\n\\nDan Janki: I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then we're starting to hear a little bit more or see the products that the domestic leisure carriers are offering. And when you look at Delta Comfort+ in that offering and compare it to what the industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of to widen that gap to the new products that are already out there or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at.\\n\\nDan Janki: Coming out theme today.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we've been out on this for years. And so we'll continue on the pace we're on. We're not going to change course. If anything, we're just going to continue to accelerate.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: See you in a month. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of or a bit of noise right now in the baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so I wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side, and was there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then just -- thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that one, going forward. What inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metrics should we be watching on that front? Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on.\\n\\nEd Bastian: And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. Appreciate the thoughts.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like, is October in your view of December, right, if we eliminate the November and the elections, are October and December positive on unit revenue?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November.\\n\\nScott Group: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about for CASM next year? I know we'll get probably more of a guide at the Analyst Day, but just directionally just puts and takes to be thinking about?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. I'd say building off of - thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we're going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You're going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you're going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You've got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know - we put the incremental investment in, we'll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we're built for it.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer, so maybe I'll try to provide a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer schedule next year. I think you even have a news article saying flights could be up high-single digit levels. Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too much away?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Really appreciate that, Glen. And then, Dan, maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I mean does this have broader implications for your airport costs because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures here on the industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage.\\n\\nEd Bastian: The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast-follower on?\\n\\nEd Bastian: This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. And then just if I may, a quick modeling question. Does your fuel guide include a refinery -- or assume a refinery benefit or a refinery headwind? Thanks again for the time everyone.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Your line is live.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now, looking at 1Q capacity, how do you feel about that? And do you feel like it's in a good spot or maybe there's more to come out or kind of how does that evolve?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And maybe just a follow-up for Dan. Congrats on the investment grade here. Obviously, kind of big change from the pandemic time. Where does that lead the balance sheet kind of going into '25 and how do you think about continued debt paydown versus cash return?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Lots went back next month looking forward to it\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, it's outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up or does premium have more to go?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year is that those incremental cuts -- capacity cuts come into play. So I would assume that main cabin, as we exit this year, is starting to improve on the margin. But we also think there's more to go on the premium products. And I think not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day. But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes. I agree with both.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications of the benefit in the main cabin catch-up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as we head into '25 or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Your line is live.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month, and we think about the long-term free cash flow generation potential at Delta. Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen. Just from transatlantic commentary seems very positive. It seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive over -- from what we can see in schedules. How would you rank the potential for transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head into 2025? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everyone and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with -- in equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative solutions across your business? Thank you.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November and thank you very much for the time.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we could repeat the instructions and for the call queue, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season, you mentioned, Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August because of the weather changes. And then, I also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've been investing a lot, obviously, the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What are you thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are some of the features that customers are asking for that maybe you're not offering now or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. I thought you mentioned talking about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like a permanent shift.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what's your thinking there, especially for the [Multiple Speakers]?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\\n\\nAlison Sider: Thanks so much. Curious, I had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious, what you're seeing in New York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there?\\n\\nPeter Carter: Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this. And what I would say is that the N90s shift seems to have gone well, but we still have the same constraints in the New York aerospace that we've had for the last couple of years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers. And I think the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that, but it's going to take some time.\\n\\nAlison Sider: And is New York kind of still the major -- that airspace is kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like, how much does that ripple out to the rest of the country?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding of the core hubs and you made a reference to getting all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what happened with your regional feed since the pandemic and how that like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Certainly, as you know, pilot constraints as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period put a lot of strain on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them and we've been working very closely with them. And now that the industry growth are patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more normalized pilot hiring across the industry. The dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is dissipating very quickly. And so, in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. Most recently, this past year, it's been more like 65% to 70%. And by next summer, we think that will be back to 100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Mary. Matthew, that will wrap us up on the media questions, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you again in January. I think many of you next month at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.\",\n",

Despite challenges from Hurricane Milton and a CrowdStrike outage, Delta achieved earnings per share at the high end of guidance and generated nearly $3 billion in free cash flow year-to-date.\\n\\nThe airline's financial results were bolstered by strong corporate travel sales, which rose 7%, and the outperformance of premium offerings compared to the main cabin. Delta's SkyMiles membership also saw growth, particularly among younger consumers, indicating increased engagement in non-air partnerships.\\n\\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, Delta expects to grow earnings by 30% year-over-year, projecting pre-tax income of $1.4 billion. The company anticipates a 2-4% increase in total revenue, supported by a 3-4% increase in capacity. However, a 1-point decline in system unit revenue is expected due to the election's impact on domestic travel.\\n\\nCFO Dan Janki reported that Delta aims to repay $4 billion in debt for the year, enhancing its balance sheet.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please note that Page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 profitability and unit metrics, consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express (NYSE:AXP) co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan.\\n\\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please go to the first analyst question?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating out that impact from what you're seeing internally? And maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks.\\n\\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just, Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic capacity kind of going forward, lower cost airlines cutting capacity? Does that make you think about share any differently here?\\n\\nEd Bastian: Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Thanks and good morning, everyone. A couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are culled provide the greatest uplift to RASM and from there RASM benefits still accrue over time, but at sort of a declining rate of improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded or is the reality of something different?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts?\\n\\nJamie Baker: The latter, the beneficiary, so Delta in this case.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery you're thinking about for 2025? But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, hypothetically, I'm not arguing that this would happen. But if we saw a full restoration to where corporate trends would be had COVID not occurred would you need to rebalance the network much or would it simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot.\\n\\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in the fourth quarter by entities and just the kind of the trends beyond the elections?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the -- follow-up on the Hurricane Helene impact. You called out, the impact of $0.03. I know it's really early days. I was just kind of curious if you have kind of the impact of Hurricane Milton in your guidance and how you're thinking about it?\\n\\nEd Bastian: It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see.\\n\\nSavi Syth: Understood. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, Glen. I recall -- I want to say this was either the last conference call or maybe it was a conference where I think you were asked about where organic demand was relative to the fact that we were seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional - driven by promotions and then our organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you talk about in the comments in your script, you talked about domestic where it seems like supply and demand are now in sync. And if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%. Are you sort of indicating that maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you just - some additional color on that?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, I think, on the distribution front, it does look like you've -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs. And I know that you've been moving more into sort of the -- on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about that, your cost of distribution. Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my question.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors.\\n\\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how aggressive do you like pretend -- like thinking -- or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others, like, you're already deepening your moat like in real time. I'm just trying to understand how deep it is or how deep you can get it from here? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that.\\n\\nDan Janki: I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then we're starting to hear a little bit more or see the products that the domestic leisure carriers are offering. And when you look at Delta Comfort+ in that offering and compare it to what the industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of to widen that gap to the new products that are already out there or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at.\\n\\nDan Janki: Coming out theme today.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we've been out on this for years. And so we'll continue on the pace we're on. We're not going to change course. If anything, we're just going to continue to accelerate.\\n\\nConor Cunningham: See you in a month. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of or a bit of noise right now in the baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so I wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side, and was there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then just -- thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that one, going forward. What inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metrics should we be watching on that front? Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on.\\n\\nEd Bastian: And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward.\\n\\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. Appreciate the thoughts.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\\n\\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like, is October in your view of December, right, if we eliminate the November and the elections, are October and December positive on unit revenue?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November.\\n\\nScott Group: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about for CASM next year? I know we'll get probably more of a guide at the Analyst Day, but just directionally just puts and takes to be thinking about?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. I'd say building off of - thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we're going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You're going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you're going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You've got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know - we put the incremental investment in, we'll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we're built for it.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer, so maybe I'll try to provide a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer schedule next year. I think you even have a news article saying flights could be up high-single digit levels. Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too much away?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Really appreciate that, Glen. And then, Dan, maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I mean does this have broader implications for your airport costs because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures here on the industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage.\\n\\nEd Bastian: The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us.\\n\\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast-follower on?\\n\\nEd Bastian: This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time.\\n\\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. And then just if I may, a quick modeling question. Does your fuel guide include a refinery -- or assume a refinery benefit or a refinery headwind? Thanks again for the time everyone.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now, looking at 1Q capacity, how do you feel about that? And do you feel like it's in a good spot or maybe there's more to come out or kind of how does that evolve?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And maybe just a follow-up for Dan. Congrats on the investment grade here. Obviously, kind of big change from the pandemic time. Where does that lead the balance sheet kind of going into '25 and how do you think about continued debt paydown versus cash return?\\n\\nDan Janki: Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value.\\n\\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Lots went back next month looking forward to it\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, it's outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up or does premium have more to go?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year is that those incremental cuts -- capacity cuts come into play. So I would assume that main cabin, as we exit this year, is starting to improve on the margin. But we also think there's more to go on the premium products. And I think not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day. But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term.\\n\\nDan Janki: Yes. I agree with both.\\n\\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications of the benefit in the main cabin catch-up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as we head into '25 or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month, and we think about the long-term free cash flow generation potential at Delta. Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\\n\\nDan Janki: Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that.\\n\\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen. Just from transatlantic commentary seems very positive. It seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive over -- from what we can see in schedules. How would you rank the potential for transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head into 2025? Thank you.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everyone and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with -- in equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative solutions across your business? Thank you.\\n\\nEd Bastian: Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned.\\n\\nStephen Trent: Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November and thank you very much for the time.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we could repeat the instructions and for the call queue, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season, you mentioned, Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August because of the weather changes. And then, I also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've been investing a lot, obviously, the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What are you thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are some of the features that customers are asking for that maybe you're not offering now or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? Thanks.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. I thought you mentioned talking about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like a permanent shift.\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what's your thinking there, especially for the [Multiple Speakers]?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting.\\n\\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\\n\\nAlison Sider: Thanks so much. Curious, I had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious, what you're seeing in New York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there?\\n\\nPeter Carter: Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this. And what I would say is that the N90s shift seems to have gone well, but we still have the same constraints in the New York aerospace that we've had for the last couple of years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers. And I think the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that, but it's going to take some time.\\n\\nAlison Sider: And is New York kind of still the major -- that airspace is kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like, how much does that ripple out to the rest of the country?\\n\\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding of the core hubs and you made a reference to getting all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what happened with your regional feed since the pandemic and how that like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt?\\n\\nGlen Hauenstein: Certainly, as you know, pilot constraints as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period put a lot of strain on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them and we've been working very closely with them. And now that the industry growth are patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more normalized pilot hiring across the industry. The dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is dissipating very quickly. And so, in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. Most recently, this past year, it's been more like 65% to 70%. And by next summer, we think that will be back to 100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019.\\n\\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\\n\\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Mary. Matthew, that will wrap us up on the media questions, please.\\n\\nOperator: Certainly.\\n\\nJulie Stewart: Thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you again in January. I think many of you next month at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.\",\n",

It should not be assumed that any of the securities transactions or holdings discussed were or will prove to be profitable. See \\\"Disclaimers\\\" at the end for more details.\\n\\nClick to enlarge\\n\\nKKR & Co Inc\\n\\nKKR continues to deliver strong performance this year. The company has reported an uptick in capital markets activity, which had previously slowed, leading to increased fees from transactions and the potential for more realizations and carried interest as M&A activity resumes.\\n\\nAdditionally, KKR has entered a new fundraising cycle, recently securing a $10 billion first close on its Infrastructure V fund. In recent years, KKR has strategically emphasized infrastructure, credit, and real estate, with its core flagship strategies representing only 6% of total AUM fundraising. Now, the company is refocusing efforts on raising capital for its flagship North American and Asian buyout funds, positioning itself for continued growth in earnings and carried interest moving forward.\\n\\nBrookfield Corp\\n\\nBrookfield delivered a strong presentation during its capital markets day, setting ambitious goals for the years ahead. The company aims to achieve a 17% compound annual growth in distributable earnings per share from 2024 to 2029 and generate $45bn in cashflows over that period. Of which $24bn will be \\\"excess cashflows\\\" after dividends and reinvestment, which can be used for share repurchases.\\n\\nA key focus of Brookfield's strategy is its wealth management business, where it aims to grow AUM from $110 billion to $300 billion by expanding in the U.S. and entering European pension markets and Japanese annuities. Brookfield believes it can leverage its investment expertise to offer consumers 4-5% returns while maintaining a consistent spread through its diverse investment opportunities. Although there is a risk that spreads could compress in a declining interest rate environment, Brookfield is confident that its investment acumen and deal flow will support sustained healthy returns, targeting 15-20% ROEs.\\n\\nRegarding real estate, which has been a significant challenge since the pandemic-driven shift to remote work, the company reaffirmed that performance remains strong within its high-quality core portfolio and plans to move its $15 billion in core assets into its insurance and wealth management accounts, providing a better home for long-term, stable cash flows. At the same time, the company intends to sell $7 billion of its $8 billion in \\\"transition and development\\\" properties to reinvest in other opportunities.\\n\\nBrookfield's recent appointment of 36-year-old Connor Teskey, a rising star and current head of Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), as future CEO, alongside Bruce Flatt's eventual transition to Chairman, mirrors KKR's smooth leadership change in 2021. By grooming internal talent, Brookfield signals its commitment to long-term sustainability and a strong corporate culture, setting the stage for continued compounding in line with its five-year plan.\\n\\nProsus NV\\n\\nProsus' new CEO, who assumed the role in July, is focused on improving the company's operational performance. With his background at iFood and given that food delivery accounts for one-third of Prosus' non-listed assets -- including stakes in Delivery Hero (OTCPK:DLVHF) and Swiggy -- some analysts speculate that Prosus may pursue mergers and acquisitions in European food delivery. A potential combination of iFood, Delivery Hero, and JustEatTakeaway, for instance, could generate over $300 million in annual cost savings and pave the way for a spin-off or other strategic actions, in line with management's long-term goal of unlocking value beyond its Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) holdings.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Prosus' share price has benefited from China's recent comprehensive stimulus package, which sparked a rally in Chinese equities. Key measures included a 20-basis point cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate to 1.5%, a 0.5% reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, injecting 1 trillion yuan into the financial system, as well as mortgage rate cuts and lower down payment ratios for second homes. China also provided 500 billion yuan in liquidity support to stabilize its stock market. While the long-term effects of these measures are uncertain, I hope this event demonstrates the potential rewards of patiently holding onto undervalued quality assets, even when it's difficult to predict the exact catalyst for a share price re-rating.\\n\\nFairfax Financial Holdings Ltd\\n\\nFairfax Financial Holdings continues to demonstrate the ability to generate robust returns from thriving insurance operations and a disciplined investment approach. Fairfax's insurance operations reported solid underwriting performance, with a combined ratio of 93.9% and positive reserving. It now consolidates Gulf Insurance, which it acquired earlier in the year, and which helped grow net written premiums by 11.5% (3% ex-Gulf). The company has hinted that it has significant opportunities for international growth in insurance.\\n\\nPeter Clarke, President and COO, remarked during the last earnings call, \\\"We've never had this kind of visibility on the investment side, and it puts Fairfax in an excellent position from an earnings and a capital perspective for the next few years.\\\" The investment portfolio currently stands at $66 billion, of which $37 billion is in fixed income, $9 billion in cash and short-term investments, and $20 billion in equities. As the company has evolved in recent years, more of its performance is now driven by insurance and private businesses, with less reliance on fluctuations in marketable securities. Fairfax reiterated its expectation of achieving $4 billion in operating income, derived from interest and dividends, underwriting profits, and contributions from its non-insurance associates. Notable transactions included the $862 million acquisition of Sleep Country Holdings and the sale of Stelco (OTCPK:STZHF) shares to Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), resulting in a $390 million gain. Fairfax also continued its share repurchase program, spending $678 million in the quarter, underscoring management's belief that its shares remain undervalued despite trading above reported book value.\\n\\nCogent Communications Holdings Inc\\n\\nIn its latest earnings release, Cogent reported steady, albeit unspectacular, performance in its core operations. There has been some progress on extracting cost synergies from the Sprint acquisition, and there is some potential for value creation through monetizing \\\"hidden assets\\\" from its IPv4 and data center co-location fees. The company has made progress in realizing cost synergies from the spring acquisition and may unlock additional value by monetizing \\\"hidden assets\\\" such as its IPv4 holdings and data center co-location fees. However, the crux of the investment thesis remains the potential for significant revenue growth from waves. Without this catalyst, I believe the stock could drop to the low $60s, but with waves revenues materializing, the upside potential could exceed $150.\\n\\nIt is interesting to see what happened with Lumen (LUMN), a competitor to Cogent, after announcing a $5 billion deal to build a custom network for Microsoft's (MSFT) data centers on July 24th. The stock jumped from around $1.50 to approximately $7 per share. From my understanding and based on reading a short seller report, 2 Lumen is primarily acting as a contractor in this deal, and it is estimated to retain only $800 million in one-time profits from construction and only $21 million in recurring profits.\\n\\nIn contrast, Cogent has the potential to generate over $500 million in recurring operating profits 3 if it can successfully sell its wave revenues over the next few years. The capital expenditure is much more limited, as Cogent is connecting an existing infrastructure that all its customers can use instead of a bespoke construction for just one customer. While I don't expect the same dramatic market reaction as Lumen's, Lumen's stock rally was partly due to relief from its potential bankruptcy risk as the influx of cash will help manage its substantial $18 billion debt; I do think this situation reflects the market's appetite for companies providing infrastructure critical to AI and cloud development.\\n\\nCirata Plc\\n\\nCirata recently faced a setback with the departure of its CFO, who joined the company in April 2023 as part of the turnaround management team. The CFO left for a role at another private company. This departure further underscores that turning the company around has been more challenging than new management expected.\\n\\nOne significant issue hindering Cirata's progress is its underdeveloped sales and marketing infrastructure, and the complex nature of larger enterprise sales. Despite the substantial untapped potential for data migration services amidst the growing cloud computing investments, Cirata has struggled to capitalize on these opportunities and announced some deal slippage in its first-half results. The company still believes it can hit its targets and close deals in the second half of the year. On September 30th, Cirata announced the renewal of its contract with Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) for its Fusion product. This renewal, valued at $983,010, provided a glimmer of hope and contributed to a rally in the stock price. Nevertheless, more such contracts are urgently needed to demonstrate the company's ability to ramp up sales effectively. As previously communicated, I will give Cirata until the end of the year to achieve tangible sales growth, or I will cut it from the portfolio.\\n\\nAlphabet Inc\\n\\nAlphabet's solid quarterly performance, with revenue growth of 14% and improved margins improving from 29% to 32%, has been overshadowed by ongoing investor concerns regarding future capital expenditures for AI and antitrust risks.\\n\\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search and advertising markets in the United States by using exclusive agreements with browser developers, smartphone makers, and wireless carriers. A second trial is scheduled for 2025 to determine enforcement remedies, with a final decision not likely before 2026, given the strong likelihood of Alphabet appealing any decision. Potential remedies may include making search engine data available to competitors and ending agreements to secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices. For example, Alphabet currently pays $20 billion annually for Google to be the default search engine on Apple products. Although regulatory challenges are never positive, Google's strong brand and consumer preference have limited the impact of previous restrictions. In Europe, Russia, and Turkey, Google search market share declined by only 2%, 7%, and 12%, respectively, when regulators limited its use as the default option.\\n\\nAnother trial focuses on Alphabet's Ad Tech platform, where the DOJ alleges that the company has monopolized the digital advertising market. Closing arguments are expected in the coming weeks, and a ruling against Alphabet could undermine Google's dominance in the online advertising ecosystem. Additionally, after the end of the quarter, Alphabet was ordered to open its Android operating system to rivals, allowing them to establish their own app marketplaces and payment systems to compete with Google Play Store. This followed a loss to Epic Games, the developer behind Fortnite, in a December ruling last year.\\n\\nI will continue to monitor these developments and respond accordingly.\\n\\nMelrose Industries Plc\\n\\nI have initiated a new position in Melrose Industries. As with many of my new investments, I tend to enter positions when companies are facing temporary headwinds that create opportunities for attractive valuations. While it's impossible to perfectly time the bottom, I believe the long-term outlook for Melrose is promising. I have included a summary write-up at the end of this letter.\\n\\nOaktree Specialty Lending Corp\\n\\nOCSL experienced a challenging quarter, with three additions to its non-accrual portfolio. The most concerning investment is Pluralsight, a provider of tech skills development services. Despite appointing a new CEO to address performance issues in April, OCSL has written down the investment by 50%. The other two non-accrual investments, AT Holdings and Dialyze, are primarily related to PIK interest and warrants acquired at a low cost. OCSL remains confident in recovering these investments. As part of the Oaktree family, OCSL benefits from a robust platform and a deep bench of expertise to manage its non-accrual investments.\\n\\nThe declining interest rate environment poses a potential threat to net interest margin. To mitigate this impact and support the dividend, the company voluntarily waived $3.2 million in incentive management fees, resulting in a $0.01 per-share increase in net interest income. While not ideal, this action demonstrates management's commitment to preserving shareholder value. At the current share price, OCSL now pays a dividend yield of over 13%, mainly from first lien credits.\\n\\nAmazon.com Inc\\n\\nAmazon's continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\\n\\nIn previous letters, I mentioned how Amazon's heavy investments in logistics and fulfillment suppressed margins for some time, but the company is now reaping the rewards of those earlier expenditures. European operations have been profitable for the second consecutive quarter, while North American operating margins have risen from pandemic lows to 5.3%. A key ongoing area of focus for Amazon has been reducing the \\\"cost to serve\\\"; this is beginning to show tangible benefits. In 2023, Amazon undertook a \\\"regionalization\\\" strategy, which divided the U.S. into eight distinct regions for fulfillment and transportation, with corresponding distribution centers in each. As I learned from an expert interview done by InPractise, \\\"regionalization\\\" has resulted in estimated shipping expenses dropping from $4.76 per unit to $4.50, and they are now approximately $4.26, with potential reductions of 2-3% annually. Interestingly, Amazon leaned on its third-party vendors (3P) to finance much of this strategy. It did so by requiring 3P vendors ship inventory to the multiple regional distribution centers, instead of to a single location as they used to do. Moreover, Amazon imposed penalties for failing to meet strict minimum and maximum quantities. In this way, Amazon used 3P inventory to expand its distribution capacity by around 24 million square feet, much of which it could use for its own 1P inventory. Clever strategy, but one wonders if this raises the risk of an eventual vendor backlash due to the added financial and logistical pressures on 3P sellers.\\n\\nLike Alphabet, Amazon is investing heavily in its AWS infrastructure to support its growing AI business. In the first half of the year, the company spent $30.5 billion on capital expenditures, with plans to exceed that in the year's second half. When questioned about this during the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that they are seeing significant demand for AI-related services, which he believes will become a \\\"very large\\\" business for Amazon.\\n\\nTrades\\n\\nI trimmed KKR and Fairfax during the quarter as part of position sizing discipline. I also trimmed a little Prosus (unfortunately just before the surprise stimulus induced run-up in share price). I redeployed some funds to Alphabet, Brookfield Corp, Distribution Solutions, and Terravest, which were all smaller positions in the portfolio, and reported what I believed were good earnings. We still have approximately 10% of the portfolio in cash, which, while a drag on returns in an upmarket, allows for flexibility should one of our positions (or any new opportunity) become attractively priced.\\n\\nSamer Hakoura\\n\\nAlphyn Capital Management, LLC\\n\\nMelrose Industries Plc\\n\\nBrief history\\n\\nMelrose was previously a publicly listed private equity firm with a strong track record of buying, fixing, and selling companies. From May 2005 to December 2023, it generated a 20% average annual return on equity investment.\\n\\nIn 2018, Melrose acquired GKN for \\u00a38.1bn in a hostile takeover, an industrial conglomerate with metallurgy, automotive, and aerospace divisions. At the time, GKN had \\u00a310 billion in revenues and only 6.5% margins. Over the next few years, Melrose embarked on a massive restructuring plan, shedding all but the aerospace division (at the time \\u00a33bn in revenues), which management described as the highest quality company they have come across. Melrose is now simply a holding company for GKN Aerospace. In 2024, the co-founders of Melrose retired (albeit with eye-popping payouts) and promoted former Melrose COO Peter Dilnot, an engineer by training, an 8-year veteran of the British Military, and a 7-year veteran of Danaher (DHR), to become CEO of the new group.\\n\\nMelrose Industries trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker MRO.LN. Its current market cap is \\u00a35.9bn, and its net debt is \\u00a31.24bn.\\n\\nGKN Aerospace Divisions\\n\\nGKN has two divisions: Engines (~35% of group sales and ~80% of group profits) and Structures.\\n\\nGKN Aerospace summary financial\\n\\n\\u00a3m\\n\\nH1 2024\\n\\n2025 guide\\n\\nEngines\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n720\\n\\n1,700\\n\\nOperating Profit\\n\\n212\\n\\n500\\n\\nMargin\\n\\n29.4%\\n\\n29.4%\\n\\nStructures\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n1,022\\n\\n2,100\\n\\nOperating Profit\\n\\n48\\n\\n200\\n\\nMargin\\n\\n4.7%\\n\\n9.5%\\n\\nTotal Aerospace\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n1,742\\n\\n3,800\\n\\nOperating Profit\\n\\n260\\n\\n700\\n\\nMargin\\n\\n14.9%\\n\\n18%\\n\\nSource: Melrose half year results August 1, 2024\\n\\nClick to enlarge\\n\\nIn the structures business, 67% of sales are civil, and 33% defense. Melrose sells wing structures, fuselages, empennages, and electrical wiring interconnection systems for narrow-body aircraft such as the Airbus A220 and A320 families and the Boeing 737. It also supplies advanced composites and metallic structures to major wide-body platforms, including the Airbus A330 and A350XWB and the Boeing 777 and 787 platforms. In defense, it supplies the F-35 fighter jet and Chinook, Apache, and NH90 helicopters.\\n\\nMelrose has undertaken significant restructuring in this division (e.g., restructuring costs were \\u00a3110m in 2023), reducing the number of sites from 40 in 2018 to 24 today and repricing specific defense contracts. Some benefits have included a cost-efficient footprint, a 75% reduction in manufacturing defects, and a 33% reduction in scrap as a percentage of sales. As a result of these initiatives, Melrose expects to double its operating margins by 9.5%.\\n\\nThe Engines division is the crown jewel of the business. 74% of its sales are civil, 26% defense. It manufactures parts such as turbine cases, fan cases, engine mount structures, and shafts. It has an advantaged position in engines, where it is a Super-Tier 1 supplier to all the major engine manufacturers GE, Pratt & Whitney, Safran (OTCPK:SAFRF), and Rolls Royce (OTCPK:RYCEY). As a result, GKN engine parts are on 90% of engines currently flying and all narrow-body aircraft. 70% of engine revenues are sole-supplier.\\n\\nIt is worth briefly summarizing the engine development cycle and how this plays into GKN's advantage.\\n\\nIt costs billions of dollars over decades to design and manufacture new engines. Once an engine platform is established, replacing it takes decades and billions of dollars. Therefore, once in production, engines have a long useful life of a few decades. They are subject to stringent mandated maintenance protocols at different hourly intervals (e.g. after 10,000 hours of use), and an engine will typically have three shop visits throughout its useful life. Most engine suppliers sell their engines at a loss and then make up their profits from aftermarket maintenance, which is their main profit driver and on which they have a high degree of visibility given the mandated maintenance requirements.\\n\\nSuper-Tier 1 suppliers like GKN are strategic partners for their OEM customers. They share in the development costs with design, validate, and build responsibility. As a result, GKN components are present on approximately 90% of all flight hours, 100% of narrow-body aircraft engines, and 70% of revenues are from privileged sole-supplier arrangements.\\n\\nThe most interesting part is the structure of revenue agreements with its Original Equipment (OE) customers. While 25% of revenues are from OE contracts, and 10% and 8%, respectively, are from Aftermarket sales from civil repairs and Government partnerships, 57% of revenues are from what are called Risk and Revenue Sharing Partnership (RRSP) agreements. Under these agreements, GKN shares in the costs of engine development with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). It generates revenues from the sale of OE components when the OEM makes engine sales (26% of total engine sales) but is also entitled to a lifetime share of aftermarket profits according to an agreed percentage (31 % of total engine sales). Due to GKN's focus on designing non-moving components like cases and mount structures, these parts typically do not require replacement throughout the engine's lifespan. Consequently, while GKN is entitled to a share of maintenance profits, it avoids the costs of supplying replacement parts or performing maintenance. This unique arrangement results in a high-margin royalty stream.\\n\\nMelrose currently has a portfolio of 19 RRSPs covering 73% of global narrow-body flight hours and 68% of global wide-body flight hours. Over the next three decades, Melrose expects to receive \\u00a322bn in cash flows from these RRSP contracts (to which it assigns a net present value of \\u00a35.7bn using a 7.5% discount rate).\\n\\nA couple of further details about the \\\"cash mountain\\\" depicted above from the RRSP portfolio: it includes approx. 29,000 older engines, such as the CFM56 and V2500, which have been in service since the early 1990s and are now generating substantial cash flow through regular maintenance. (engines in service on narrow-body aircraft) which came into service in the early 1990s. GKN has approximately 4,000 new engines, such as the Trent XWB-84K (used in widebody aircraft) and the P&W GTF series (newer engines used in narrow-body aircraft). These engines have only recently entered service (2015/6) and are still in the early stages of their maintenance cycles. Only 5-10% of these engines have had their first (of typically 3) shop visits. GKN expects to deliver approximately 19,000 more of these engines over the next 17 years, a source of significant future cash flow.\\n\\nGKN's share of aftermarket profits varies depending on the engine type. For older engines like the CFM56, GKN's share is under 2%, while it will receive 4-7% for the P&W GTF series. This favorable revenue-sharing arrangement further enhances the company's cash flow profile. Furthermore, the \\u00a322 billion valuation only reflects the current value of engines in service. GKN's involvement in developing next-generation engines like the CFMI RISE and next-gen-GTF presents additional growth opportunities and potential future cash flow streams.\\n\\nThe macro backdrop is favorable\\n\\nLong-term secular demand. Goldman Sachs estimates a market of 52,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years, or 2,700 new aircraft per year vs 1,243 delivered by Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) and Boeing (BA) in 2019.\\n\\nAir traffic has grown at 1.5x the rate of Global GDP, driving demand for new aircraft and maintenance. The industry is in the early stages of this growth, with many regions still having relatively low air travel rates. The average person in the U.S. takes two trips per year, compared to 0.5 in China and 0.1 in India.\\n\\nDevelopment of new fuel-efficient aircraft such as the 787, 737 Max, A320neo, A330neo, A350, and A220 creates an opportunity for fleet renewal, which will drive future OEM sales and subsequent aftermarket maintenance.\\n\\nSupply pressures.\\n\\nThe aerospace industry faces temporary challenges due to the pandemic, inflation, and supply chain issues. The industry relies heavily on skilled labor, has experienced workforce reductions during COVID, and is working to replace and train its new hires. Geopolitics have disrupted the supply of raw materials, such as titanium, from Russia, with companies working on reshoring. Inflation has impacted costs, with price normalization still ongoing, further exacerbated by strikes at Safran and Boeing. Well-publicized quality issues at Boeing, especially with its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner, and with P&W's GTF engine, have contributed to delays in production.\\n\\nAs a result, there is a backlog of 15,000 aircraft, with delivery slots now extending into the 2030s. According to Morgan Stanley, around 1,300 aircraft due for retirement remain in service. This extended usage drives more hours on existing engines, boosting maintenance revenues for suppliers like GKN.\\n\\nCompany specific headwinds, which I believe are temporary, make this an attractive entry point.\\n\\nGKN is more heavily weighted to Airbus production than to Boeing. Therefore, the announcement in July that Airbus expects to deliver 770 planes in 2024, down from the 800 figure shared earlier, and that its production target for its A320 narrow-body aircraft of 75 per month will be delayed by one year to 2027 was poorly received by Melrose investors. As with most supply issues, these will resolve and have the silver lining of enhanced aftermarket income from more service hours of the existing fleet.\\n\\nThe Pratt & Whitney GTF engine is an important driver of GKN's RRSP cash flow in the coming years. Unfortunately, some components were made using contaminated powdered metal between 2015 and 2021, affecting approx. 1,200 engines. The industry is working to repair an estimated 673 GTF-powered aircraft on the ground; in addition to the impact on confidence, this will cost P&W approximately $4.5bn - $5.5bn in repairs and customer compensation. GKN has a 4% share through its RRSP agreement and will pay out \\u00a3200m over the next three years.\\n\\nMelrose's 2024 H1 numbers and guidance, released in July, came in slightly below estimates on OE sales because of the continuing supply chain issues facing the industry and from the disposal of non-core businesses in structures which, as mentioned above, are undergoing significant restructuring. The company also announced slightly higher capex, \\u00a3300m over 5 years in its additive manufacturing business. Higher capex concurrent with somewhat lower revenue numbers was not well received by the market.\\n\\nAs with many of the investments I find, the numbers are messy in the short term, but I believe they will clear up over the next couple of years. Free cash flows are coming in significantly below net income, raising questions about the quality of earnings. I think some investors might worry that GKN is being aggressive with its accounting.\\n\\nFor example, the company has guided Net income for 2024 of \\u00a3350m, but FCF to only negative \\u00a344m. I think some discrete costs can explain the differences. Embedded in that number is \\u00a3140m of restructuring costs (which are now mostly complete), \\u00a370m payment for the GTF powder metal issue which will end in the next 2.5 years), and perhaps \\u00a350m in added working capital due to supply issues with Airbus and Boeing. Reversing out these temporary issues brings FCF to approximately \\u00a3215m (or a much more reasonable 60% net income). By 2026, net income could increase by \\u00a3200m to \\u00a3500m, with a corresponding increase in 2026 FCF to approximately \\u00a3400m.\\n\\nFRS accounting rules governing income recognition for Melrose's RRSPs further exacerbate the uncertainty over cash flow. As discussed previously, most of GKN's components do not require replacement for the life of an engine; GKN is deemed to finish its work at the time of delivery of components. Under IFRS, it must report revenue and profit at the time of sale and estimate the actual profits it will receive from aftermarket many years into the future. Actual cash flows do not come in for some years until the engines make shop visits for maintenance, creating a significant timing issue, where profits are much higher in the short term than cash flows.\\n\\nIn discussions with other investors, my understanding is that the cash mountain in the graphic above is derived from audited third party numbers from GE, Safran, and MTX (another supplier). If anything, Melrose likely takes a more conservative approach to estimating future profits in its accounting, with scope for upward revisions.\\n\\nNumbers\\n\\nThe following simplistic valuation exercise shows the potential attractiveness of the investment. If we take management's guidance for 2025 of \\u00a33,800 in revenues and assume it can grow 8% a year, in line with estimates for industry growth, we get to approximately \\u00a34,500m. Suppose we further assume operating margins increase from management's 2025 guidance of 18% to 20%, given the continued restructuring initiatives and high-margin aftermarket income streams. In that case, we have an approximate aerospace operating profit of \\u00a3900m. Deduct corporate costs of \\u00a330m gives \\u00a3870m in operating profits for 2027. Assuming a 14x multiple, in line with today's multiple and not factoring any multiple expansion for improved clarity on cash flows, and at a discount to comparables such as OEMs and suppliers, which average 16x, gives us a share price of ~\\u00a38 vs \\u00a34.55 at the end of the third quarter, implying a potential 20% CAGR.\\n\\nOther factors - Capital Allocation and Longer-term upside\\n\\nMelrose has set aside \\u00a3500m for share repurchases. To fund further buybacks, the company may eventually sell the structures business, which is still good but not as good as engines. The company has confirmed that, in the long term, there are few \\\"synergies\\\" between the divisions, and there isn't a solid strategic rationale to keep them under one roof. I think they want to continue building the division up before selling, so it may be a couple of years before any sale. At, say, 10x 2025 operating profit, this would give Melrose \\u00a32bn for buybacks, or one-third of the company. The number could be significantly higher to the extent they continue to drive sales growth and margin expansion in the business.\\n\\nAdditive manufacturing has long-term upside potential, which is not factored into earnings forecasts. Additive manufacturing allows for the creation of complex and lightweight components with reduced waste (saves approximately 80% of the material cost), shorter lead times, and increased customization. Melrose recently won a \\u00a35bn contract with GE over several years to develop parts using this technology. Melrose had previously invested \\u00a340m to develop this technology, and as mentioned above, it is investing a further \\u00a3300m with an expected IRR over 5 years of over 20%. The current focus is on industrializing or scaling up the technology, potentially opening up several billion in future revenues.\\n\\nRisks\\n\\nThe primary risks to this thesis are that what I have identified as temporary headwinds may evolve into more fundamental and persistent challenges. Supply chain disruptions in the industry could extend beyond current expectations. GTF powder metal issues may also face prolonged resolution timelines, exacerbating operational delays and increasing costs more than initially forecasted. The GTF engine platform, an important contributor to future cash flows, is relatively new, and future sales growth may be weaker than expected. GKN may be less successful in winning placements in future engine platforms. I could be wrong about cash flow expectations over the next few years and the visibility of cash flows in RRSPs.\\n\\nOver the very long term, the increasing importance of new markets, such as China, could disrupt the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. Changes in technology to electric or hydrogen propulsion could change the dynamics of the engine market and Melrose's competitive positioning.\\n\\n(Big thank you to Daniel at Crossroads Capital for bringing this opportunity to my attention).\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n2 Kerrisdale Capital August 2024 report, available on their website\\n\\n3 Cogent management's estimate of the addressable TAM of $2bn x management's expectation of a 25% share @ 90%+ gross margins.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\n\\nAlphyn Capital Management, LLC is a state registered investment adviser.\\n\\nThe description herein of the approach of Alphyn Capital Management, LLC and the targeted characteristics of its strategies and investments is based on current expectations and should not be considered definitive or a guarantee that the approaches, strategies, and investment portfolio will, in fact, possess these characteristics.

Benzinga Pro subscription costs are higher for premium subscribers, and offer fewer features.\\n\\nNow it's time for a quick comparison of users' experiences using Seeking Alpha and Benzinga Pro.\\n\\nReviewers on Capterra have awarded Seeking Alpha an average of 4.3 out of 5 stars, while reviewers on Trustpilot have given Seeking Alpha premium 4 out of 5 possible stars.\\n\\nSome of the things that reviewers praise include these things:\\n\\nSome of the most common issues included these things:\\n\\nIn terms of a Seeking Alpha app review, most users seem to like the app and appreciate having access to a stock market research app on the go.\\n\\nThere's only one user review for Benzinga on Capterra, and that user gave the service 4 out of 5 stars, but we can't extrapolate much from such a small sample. That user did praise the Benzinga Pro platform's usability, but took issue with the lack of analysis.\\n\\nTrustpilot has more than 600 reviews of Benzinga Pro, and they've given the service an average rating of 3.9 stars. Some of the things that reviewers praise are:\\n\\nSome of the most common complaints related to customer service response times, although many users praised customer service reps. There were several mentions of the Basic Plan being too expensive for what users get in return, and recommendations to buy the Essential Plan if you can afford it.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha's app and platform have a better UX overall, with easy access to rich data and expert analysis. Benzinga's interface could use a lot of improvement, as it has a cluttered appearance and may be difficult to navigate. Benzinga is a web-only platform that can be overwhelming for first-time users, but it works well for active traders who want immediate access to news.\\n\\nPro Tip:\\n\\nIf you sign up with Seeking Alpha Premium today, you will receive $30 off and access to an exclusive 7-day free trial!\\n\\nComparing performance metrics for Seeking Alpha and Benzinga Pro is difficult because Benzinga Pro doesn't offer ratings where we can contrast market performance. Overall, we'd say that Seeking Alpha offers highly-accurate (and historically profitable) Quant Ratings plus in-depth analysis. Benzinga Pro focuses on speed, delivering news in real time, but it lacks in-depth analysis.\\n\\nHere are the metrics we can use to rate and evaluate Seeking Alpha.\\n\\nWe should also note that Alpha Picks, another one of Seeking Alpha's premium services, has outperformed the S&P 500 by 40% since its inception.\\n\\nBenzinga Pro doesn't make stock recommendations per se, so we can't track results in the same way we can with Seeking Alpha. Here are some metrics we can use.\\n\\nOn the whole, the metrics support Seeking Alpha as the best option for most investors.\\n\\nHere are some important Pros and Cons to keep in mind as part of our investment platform comparison.\\n\\nWe think Seeking Alpha is a better choice than Benzinga Pro for most investors, but let's talk about who should use Seeking Alpha.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha is a stock analysis platform for investors. Subscribers get access to a ton of detailed analysis from both experts and community members, so anybody who wants to do a deep dive before purchasing a stock or ETF can benefit from Seeking Alpha.\\n\\nIf you're wondering: Is Seeking Alpha good for beginners, we'd say that it can be. Beginners can benefit from starting with Seeking Alpha's free plan, which offers the opportunity to ease into using the platform and get accustomed to the types of research and analysis that are available.\\n\\nIntermediate and advanced users are the ones who can leverage Seeking Alpha's Premium features. Even for some investors with experience there may be a learning curve, but it's not an overwhelming one, especially once you figure out how to customize your feed by following your favorite authors and setting up alerts for stocks in your portfolio.\\n\\nWe'd say that the Pro option is not necessary for most investors. It's pricey at $200 per month and doesn't offer that much more in the way of special features.\\n\\nWe believe that investors of all types may benefit from becoming Seeking Alpha Premium subscribers. At the very least, we'd recommend checking out the one-month trial for $4.95, which offers the chance to try out the premium features and see if they're right for you. If you are interested in learning more about what Seeking Alpha has to offer, check out our article covering the subject here.\\n\\nHere are our final thoughts on Seeking Alpha vs. Benzinga Pro and which stock screener is best.\\n\\nBenzinga Pro is best suited for people who want to actively manage their investments and move quickly based on stock market news. It's not for those who want to dig into company financials and read expert analysis.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha is the best platform for people who are looking for depth, affordability, and access to expert analysis. You can access 10 years of financials, tons of news and expert analysis, and get access to Quant Ratings, Wall Street Analyst ratings, and a robust set of portfolio management tools, including the Portfolio Health Grade.\\n\\nOn the whole, we believe that Seeking Alpha is a better choice for most investors than Benzinga Pro. It offers more features at a more affordable price.\\n\\nGet Seeking Alpha Premium for $30 OFF.\\n\\nThere are no free trials, but Seeking Alpha offers a free basic plan. You can also get a 30-day trial of Seeking Alpha Premium for $4.95 or a 30-day trial of Seeking Alpha Pro for $99. Benzinga doesn't offer a free plan or any free trials at this time.\\n\\nBenzinga Pro offers only market news to help investors choose stocks to buy. It's not an analysis site and doesn't offer much in the way of research. By contrast, Seeking Alpha offers users access to expert and community analysis, Quant ratings, Wall Street Analyst ratings, plus advanced screeners and a Portfolio Health Grade.\\n\\nUltimately Seeking Alpha offers more research options and analysis than Benzinga, and is better suited for most investors.\\n\\nInvestors who value research and analysis want to understand the potential risks and rewards of investments before they buy them. While Benzinga Pro's real-time information is undeniably useful to day traders, many investors prefer to have access to more concrete information before making investment decisions.\",\n",

      "    \"title\": \"The Q3 Earnings Season Kicks Off Positively\",\n",
      "    \"body\": \"The market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan JPM and Wells Fargo WFC, even though Wells Fargo came up short on the top-line while JPMorgan beat both top- and bottom-line expectations.\\n\\nEven more important than the two banks' Q3 EPS and revenue surprises is their favorable commentary on business trends and the economy's overall health. Questions about the economy's outlook have been front and center for the market lately, with some in the market fearing that the Fed may have delayed the onset of its easing cycle.\\n\\nThe JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reports and management commentaries are reassuring on this count as they see a stable and positive spending environment, notwithstanding some stress at the lower end of the income distribution.\\n\\nWhile taking nothing away from the banks' positive results, part of the contributing factor to the market's favorable reaction is the reassuring read-through about the macro backdrop. This is a net positive for JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares, which had lost ground lately. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares relative to the market.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nJPMorgan's Q3 earnings were -1.9% below the year-earlier level on +7% higher revenues. The bank beat EPS and revenue estimates on better-than-expected net interest earnings and also provided positive guidance on this front for the current period. The company had warned recently of elevated net interest earnings expectations for next year, which had weighed on the stock since then. They reiterated that view after the Q3 earnings release, but the market appears to be discounting that outlook following the positive Q3 results.\\n\\nIn the core banking business, profitability remains constrained by margin pressures, cyclically soft demand for credit, and some deterioration in credit quality, albeit from a shallow level. On the capital markets side, trading revenues remain strong, and the investment banking business has started showing signs of growth but remains below the strong level two years ago.\\n\\nThere has been talk of 'green shoots' concerning deal pipelines, which many hope will translate into actual activities in the post-election phase now that the Fed has initiated the easing cycle. JPMorgan's investment banking fees increased more than +29% in Q3, with strong activities on the debt capital markets side.\\n\\nThe positive results from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo provide a positive read-through for the coming reports from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and others.\\n\\nRegarding the Q3 earnings season scorecard for the Finance sector, we now have results from 15.6% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance companies are down -0.1% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nLooking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +4.7% on +5% higher revenues.\\n\\nThe chart below shows the sector's Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what we saw from the sector in the last two periods and what is expected in the following three quarters.\\n\\nIncluding the aforementioned JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reports, we now have Q3 results for 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 29 index members that have already reported results are up +7.1% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 65.5% beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nThe Q3 reporting cycle ramps up this week, with over 100 companies on deck to report results, including 40 S&P 500 members. Banks, brokers, and other Finance sector players dominate this week's reporting docket, but we do have a fair amount of representation from other sectors, including Proctor & Gamble, Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, Schlumberger, CSX Corp., United Airlines, and others.\\n\\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for the 29 index members that have reported results in a historical context.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nIt is premature to identify any trends at this very early stage. Still, the favorable comparison of the revenue beats percentage will be significant if it endures through the rest of the Q3 reporting cycle.\\n\\nThe Earnings Big Picture\\n\\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining results from the companies that have reported already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.6% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. This would follow the +10.2% earnings growth for the index in the preceding period on +5.5% higher revenues.\\n\\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what we saw in actual results over the preceding four quarters and what is expected over the following three quarters.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nNotwithstanding the modest growth pace in Q3, the aggregate earnings total for the period is expected to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.7% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nPlease note that this year's +7.7% earnings growth improves to +9.6% on an ex-Energy basis.\\n\\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> A Detailed Analysis of Q3 Earnings Expectations\\n\\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

Also joining us for the question-and-answer segment are Denise Faltischek, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of International; Blair McNeil, President of Tilray Canada; and Ty Gilmore, President of Tilray Beverages, North America.\\n\\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands' Chairman and CEO, Irwin Simon.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nThank you, Berrin. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In the last five years, Tilray Brands has evolved into a new company. We no longer are just a Canadian cannabis LP. Tilray Brands has grown tremendously, and we're setting a new precedent for the CPG industry. Not only have we set the stage for a new era of consumer habits, Tilray Brands has pushed forward, disrupting the global CPG industry and revolutionizing consumer products.\\n\\nTilray is at the forefront of innovation, pioneering, and leading the convergence of beverages, cannabis, hemp, wellness, and distribution industries on a global scale. Our operations span over 20 countries and five continents with 44 consumer-connected lifestyle brands and 20 vertically integrated facilities that produce approximately 90% of our products in-house, ensuring the highest quality of our products.\\n\\nTilray continues to lead with the number-one cannabis business in Canada, leading medical cannabis business across Europe, the number-one branded hemp business in North America, and the fifth largest craft beer business in the US.\\n\\nOur success in building a new era of consumer products that resonates with today's discerning consumers and caters to their ever-evolving consumption habits and transforming the way consumers eat, drink, and unwind with cannabis, hemp, and beverage products is a testament to our commitment on delivering innovative products that meet the needs of the modern consumer and drive growth across industries.\\n\\nMoving on to Q1, we achieved our record first-quarter net revenue results while strengthening our operations, increasing gross margin, and increasing our gross profit. We hit net revenue of $200 million, representing a 13% growth year over year. Our gross profit increased by 35%, and gross margin increased by over 500 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nOur beverage business, including craft beer, spirits, and our new non-alc beers and other non-alcoholic drinks grew 132% in net revenue year over year. We strengthened our leadership position as the fifth largest US craft beer brewer with a 5% market share as a result of our craft acquisition from ABI.\\n\\nWe recently launched a new beverage division called Tilray Alternative Beverages, focused on fueling key markets across the US with innovative federally legal hemp-derivative Delta-9 EAC-branded and branded products. This is an exciting new segment for us and our network of distributors, which I'll get into in more detail shortly.\\n\\nWe focus our cannabis business on strengthening our operations and increasing our margins, leading to our gross profit increasing by 22%. We continue to lead the branded hemp food industry with a 52% branded market share with Manitoba Harvest in the US and the Canadian market share of nearly 80%. And our financial foundation remains strong with a robust balance sheet, ample cash reserves, reduced debt levels, and flexibility to explore potential new acquisitions. Our financial strength enables us to pursue new opportunities and capitalize on emerging trends in the market.\\n\\nLet's now dive deeper into each of our business segments, starting with Tilray Beverages. Today, our beverage division leads with 19 iconic brands, 10 network manufacturing facilities, and over 700 distributors, 20 brew pubs and restaurants, and leading sales and marketing teams across the US. Our beverage strategy is focused on growing our portfolio brands in selected states, regional markets, and ensuring product excellence and innovation, driving focused scale, expanding targeted distribution to increase our market presentation and consumer access.\\n\\nIn our beverage segment, we generated $56 million of net revenue in Q1. Across our growing craft brands, SweetWater is the number-one volume brand family in Georgia, multi-outlet, and convenience stores. Montauk is the number-one branded family in New York Metro, having increased at a rate of sale of 240 basis points year over year. And Tilray is the number-one craft supplier in the Pacific Northwest, thanks in part to the continued success of 10 Barrel's pub beer.\\n\\nShock Top remains a leading priority as we relaunch the brand's number-one seasonal offering, Shock Top Pretzel. During Q1 and Q2, driving an additional 5,000 distribution points in the last 45 days. The Pacific Northwest grew overall Shock Top distribution by 42% during the Q1, adding 1,100 new placements for the brand. In the Northeast, Montauk's flagship Wave Chaser IPA continues to post positive year-over-year volume distribution gains, adding a net of 139 off-premise accounts during Q1.\\n\\nThree of SweetWater's top 12-pack SKUs, 420 Pale Ale, OG IPA, and the Hazy IPA, all posted positive trends for Q1, trending a plus 7%, a plus 24%, and a plus 17%, respectively. As we mentioned before, our ambition is far beyond our current reach as we continue our focus to become a dominant leading beverage business by leveraging and strengthening our portfolio of beloved local craft brands, recruiting new customers, and activating more occasions, driving new growth across these brands.\\n\\nAdditionally, we are innovating across adjacent categories, including flavored malt beverages, ready-to-drink cocktails, spirits. And also beyond alcohol, we will grow our non-alc beer category and expand further into water, energy, and other categories. Our powerful college sports partnerships across the country will be leveraged to bring new LDA consumers and fans into different brand families, especially Shock Top.\\n\\nSeparately, our MLS music events and local community partnerships allow our brands to recruit and retain our core customers across different age groups. We have the manufacturing facilities, the distribution, the sales and marketing infrastructure to drive tremendous growth in the Tilray beverage business.\\n\\nIn the non-alcoholic segment, Montauk non-alc craft beer is now sold in 650 counts, and a new brand, Runner's High Brewing Company, has launched in the southeast with three brews, Runner's High Golden Wheat, Raspberry Wheat, and Dark Chocolate with several expansion markets to follow. With over 700 beer distributors, Tilray is now a leading supplier in key regions across the US, with regional jewels in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, and the Southeast.\\n\\nWith each beverage acquisition we've made over the past few years, SweetWater, Green Flash, Alpine, Montauk Brewing, the craft acquisitions from ABI, and most recently, the acquisitions of our four brands from Molson Coors, we are laser-focused on operational efficiency, optimizing cost structure, and getting the margins of the acquired brands up above 40%, like SweetWater and our other legacy businesses.\\n\\nWe've identified additional growth opportunities in our beverage business. Tilray Beverage is going after category diversification, and we've identified four categories we expect to generate $30 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025. These four categories include light lagers, $117 million category; flavored malt beverages, a $4.7 billion category; sparkling water, a $12 billion category, and the non-alc group, a $445 million category.\\n\\nWith our recent launch of Tilray Alternative Beverages, we are focused on fueling the US with hemp-derived Delta 9 beverages, which is an estimated $2.8 billion market in the US. We're beginning to launch our hemp-derivative Delta-9 THC brands and products in key states, including Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, with distribution driven by our existing and robust beer distribution network.\\n\\nOur initial portfolio of HDD9 brands include Happy Flower, Herb & Bloom, 420 Hops, Fizzy Jane, and we expect to launch additional brands by the end of this calendar year. Happy Flower is currently available online through Drink Happy Flower. The growth of hemp-derived Delta 9 THC drink business in the US is remarkable, and we are excited to see its potential for our beer distribution network, who are eager to jump into the business and have already begun placing orders. We look forward to sharing more updates on this development soon.\\n\\nTurning to Tilray Cannabis, in Canada, Tilray's continues to lead the Canadian market share by almost 170 bps over the next competitor and have been consistently at the top of the industry for the past three years. From a regional perspective, Tilray is number one across British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. These provinces combined include over 86% of the Canadian population. We've also led in all other markets combined.\\n\\nIn adult-use recreational cannabis, we focus on margin improvement across our portfolio of brands and products, resulting in improved adjusted gross margin by 500 basis points in Q1 versus last year. The margin improvement partnered with efficient utilization, production, and further cost savings initiatives will allow us to grow our revenue, profitability, and sustainability well into the future.\\n\\nIn Q1, 20% of our net sales revenue came from new innovation. Our mainstream flower business continued to grow because of our strong genetics. Our Redecan brand moved up to the number-six position brand in Canada, as reported by Hifyre data. In beverages, Tilray continues to dominate the beverage category with a 45% market share, and at the end of August with XMG, Mollo THC beverage brands being the number-one and number-two brands respectively.\\n\\nTilray shipped 78 metric tonnes of biomass or approximately 25% of the implied Canadian market volume in Q1. We continue to leverage the wholesale channel where contribution margins are better and supply is starting to balance. On an adult rack, we shipped 16 million pre-rolled cones and over 2.1 million cans of beverages in Q1.\\n\\nTurning to our international business in Q1, we continue to execute against our three basic initiatives. First, the acceleration of growth in Germany. In Germany, since the Cannabis Act went into effect on April 1, 2024, we've seen a 50% increase in medical flower sales, as well as a 22% increase in medical cannabis extracts, where we already have a dominant share of the market. And we believe that our current positioning in Germany provides us with several unique competitive advantages to capture a significant share of the expected medical cannabis market, which is projected to be approximately $3 billion in the medium term.\\n\\nWe expect to continue our growth in this very important market through commercial excellence and increased supply. We will continue to leverage the expertise and relationship of our CC Pharma Tilray pharma distribution business in Germany, which supports our medical cannabis business through its network of 13,000 pharmacy and wholesalers.\\n\\nSecond, the bifurcation and differentiation of physician-led and patient-led channels. As a market leader in the physician-led channel, we're turning our focus to accelerating our growth in the patient-led channel. One of our major initiatives in this regard is improving the availability and the quality of our medical cannabis supply to meet needs of patients-led channels by creating a flexible and diversified supply chain focused on high-quality flower and new innovation.\\n\\nAt Aphria RX, our German cultivation and processing facility, we received the very first commercial cannabis cultivation license and commercial distribution license issued in Germany under the new regulations. These new licenses granted Tilray the ability to cultivate, produce, and distribute premium quality medical cannabis with the ability to increase our production by approximately 5 times.\\n\\nAphria RX can now fully utilize and maximize its growing capacity while also expanding its genetics to a total of 31 approved strains from the previously approved three strains. We've already completed our first harvest under new cultivation license. We expect to commercialize these products in Q2.\\n\\nWe've also begun to supply our international markets with EU GMP-certified medical cannabis products from our Canadian facilities, with medical cannabis from Aphria Diamond launching in Poland, and Broken Coast and Redecan launching in Australia. We expect to launch additional cultivation from Broken Coast and Aphria Diamond in the coming months.\\n\\nAnd finally, we'll continue to identify and enter new markets with the potential to generate material revenue and profit opportunities. We expect European opportunities could represent a potential $45 billion medical market over the long term. And with our presence in Europe, it allows Tilray to grow our global brand portfolio to a base of over 700 million people in Europe, which is twice the population of the US.\\n\\nFinally, let's discuss our Tilray wellness business, focused on improving people's lives through the power of hemp. Tilray Wellness is represented mainly by Manitoba Harvest, our leading hemp brand with over a 53% market share in branded hemp products. Wellness is also comprised of Happy Flower beverages and highball energy drinks.\\n\\nIn Q1, Tilray Wellness delivered 11% net revenue growth compared to the prior year, driven by strong core business sales coupled with hemp innovation and expansion into wellness beverages. A strong focus on cost helped the business improve margins, delivering a 300-basis-point-increase in gross margin to 32%.\\n\\nAs Tilray Brands has transformed, expanded, and completed numerous acquisitions to get where we are today, our mission has evolved to be a leading premium lifestyle company with a house of brands and innovation of products that inspire joy, wellness, and create memorable experiences.\\n\\nWith that, I'll now turn the call to Carl to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Carl?\\n\\nCarl Merton\\n\\nThank you, Irwin. As a reminder, our financial results are presented in accordance with US GAAP and in US dollars. Let's now review our quarterly performance for the three months ended August 31, 2024. In Q1, net revenue was $200 million, a 13% growth rate compared to the previous-year quarter net revenue of $177 million. As Irwin stated, our Q1 net revenue was a record amount.\\n\\nIn constant currency, net revenue grew to $204 million. By segment, beverage alcohol net revenue increased 132% to $56 million. Cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million as a result of our strong focus on margins and strategic growth in key markets, which I will discuss in a moment. Distribution net revenue was flat, and wellness net revenue rose 11% in the quarter.\\n\\nFrom a segment perspective, 28% of our net revenue was generated by our beverage alcohol business, 31% was generated by our cannabis business, 34% by our distribution business, and 7% by our wellness business. This compares to 13% in beverage alcohol, 40% in cannabis, 39% in distribution, and 8% in wellness in the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nThe year-over-year variance is due to our craft beverage acquisition, which occurred in Q2 of last year. Gross profit increased by 35% to $59.7 million compared to $44.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin increased to 30% and over a 500-basis-point increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted gross profit increased 21% to $59.9 million from $49.3 million in the prior year, while adjusted gross margin increased by 200 basis points to 30%, primarily reflecting our focus on improving our utilizations at our beverage alcohol facilities and favorable sales mix.\\n\\nNet loss improved by 38% to $34.7 million compared to a net loss of $55.9 million in the prior-year quarter. On a per-share basis, this amounted to a net loss of $0.04 per share, which was a 60% improvement compared to a net loss of $0.10 per share in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net loss was $6.1 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $27.1 million in the prior-year quarter, a 78% improvement year over year, with adjusted net loss per share coming in at negative $0.01 per share, a significant beat compared to expectations of negative $0.05.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million compared to $10.7 million in the prior-year quarter. We are now approaching six consecutive years of generating positive adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA from the prior-year quarter is primarily related to building infrastructure and an increased investment in marketing and promotions at Tilray Beverages.\\n\\nCash flow used in operations was $35.3 million compared to $15.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was negative $39.5 million compared to negative $6.3 million in the prior-year quarter as a result of an increased demand on our working capital in our beverage operations as we move from the payment terms under the co-manufacturing agreements to our own payment terms after integrating production.\\n\\nTurning now to our four business segments, average alcohol net revenue was $56 million, up 132% from $24.2 million in the prior year. The positive delta was due to contributions from the craft brands, which were purchased during Q2 of last year, and new innovations across our brand portfolio.\\n\\nThrough our expanding footprint, we now own and operate 20 brew pubs/restaurants in the US that are in close proximity to the production of our craft brands. In the quarter, these operations contributed $11 million of revenue, and we expect them to be a key part of our strategy going forward, allowing us to increase brand visibility and gain an intimate understanding of our key consumers.\\n\\nBeverage alcohol gross profit increased to $22.9 million compared to $12.9 million, and adjusted gross profit was $23.1 million compared to $13.5 million, while beverage alcohol gross margin was 41% compared to 53%, and adjusted gross margin was 41% from 56% from the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nDue to the seasonality of our beverage business, our third quarter ended February 29, 2024, is our most comparable period, reflecting the newly acquired craft brands to which we improved adjusted gross margin by over 300 basis points as a result of our efforts in integrating and optimizing our facilities as well as a favorable product base.\\n\\nAs we mentioned at year end, the new craft brands were initially subject to co-manufacturing agreements, inhibiting our ability to optimize production and control costs in a manner sufficient to increase our gross profit and margin. Effective May 31, all the co-manufacturing agreements, except for production of Shock Top, ended and the production of the brands were in-house, with Shock Top's production expected to be integrated into our production facilities in Q2.\\n\\nAs we integrate production in-house, we are able to better optimize production utilization in our facilities, decreasing unabsorbed overheads, as well as achieving purchase price synergies now that we are purchasing the raw ingredients.\\n\\nGross cannabis revenue of $81.2 million was comprised of $57.2 million in Canadian adult use revenue, $12.2 million in international cannabis revenue, $6.3 million in Canadian medical cannabis revenue, and $5.5 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue, which includes $20 million in excise taxes, was $61.2 million, representing a 13% decrease from the year-ago period.\\n\\nRevenue from Canadian medical cannabis grew 2%, despite the category being impacted by competition from the adult-use market, while revenue from Canadian adult use decreased 20%, which was a result of our increased focus on preserving gross margin and maintaining a higher average selling price in categories that have experienced a high degree of price compression.\\n\\nInternational cannabis revenue decreased by 14%, which was largely driven by variability on the timing in countries other than Germany of receiving import and export permits, resulting in fluctuations on a quarterly basis. As Irwin said already, in the five months since legalization versus the five months before legalization, our flower revenues in Germany are up 50%, and our extract sales are up 22%.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, cannabis net revenue was in line with expectations at $61.2 million, but down $9.1 million versus the prior year. As we focus on our goal of improving cannabis gross margins, we are intentionally less focused on share and revenue in certain categories, particularly those categories facing the most price compression, including infused, pre-roll, and vape.\\n\\nDespite the decline in net revenue and share in those categories, we increased cannabis gross profit by $4.4 million and increased adjusted cannabis gross margin by over 500 basis points from the prior-year period. Cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million, and cannabis gross margin was 40%. Adjusted cannabis gross profit was $24.2 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The gross margin increase was driven by our international cannabis business, and in Canada, our continued focus on maintaining a higher average selling price and selling a favorable product mix to improve adjusted gross margins by 500 basis points.\\n\\nDistribution net revenue, derived predominantly through Tilray Pharma, was $68.1 million compared to $69.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in net revenue is attributed to the effects of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, revenue from distribution increased to $70.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of $69.2 million for the prior-year period. Distribution gross profit increased to $7.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior-year period, while distribution gross margin increased to 12% from 11% in the prior-year quarter because of product mix.\\n\\nWellness net revenue grew 11% to $14.8 million from $13.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by our strategic focus on continued innovations and strong organic growth within our branded hemp business related to higher consumption. Wellness gross profit was $4.7 million, up from $3.8 million in the prior-year quarter, and gross margin rose to 32% compared to 29% as a result of decreased input costs and continued operational efficiencies.\\n\\nOur cash and marketable securities balance as of October 31 was $280.1 million, up from $260.5 million at year end. This change was a result of our temporary increase in working capital demands, offset by the funds raised from our ATM. Since its initiation, we have raised $94.5 million on our ATM, which we intend to use for strategic and accretive acquisitions, including capital expenditures for acquired businesses.\\n\\nLet me now conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) Kaumil Gajrawala, Jefferies.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala\\n\\nHey, guys. Good morning. Can I ask a bit about the Canadian adult-use market and just how volumes are trending?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nI missed that last comment. How volume-dependent it is?\\n\\nBlair's on the phone. I'll let him jump in a second. But I think the big thing that you see in Canada, how we've improved our margins there tremendously. And with Canada now being legal for five years, there's a lot of LPs that have come and gone. And with us having 5 million square feet in Canada and being one of the largest and being the number one, there's a lot of volume.\\n\\nBut the volume we're going to go after is profitable volume, and there's sales that will give up for it. In the period, we introduced a lot of new products, a lot of new innovation. And what we've done with our facilities in regards to our yields, in regards to some of the products that we're doing today, and the amount of pre-rolls, we sell over 80 million pre-rolls a year. We sell over 350 metric tonnes of flower a year. So volume is absolutely dependent, but it's profitable volume.\\n\\nBlair, you want to add anything to it?\\n\\nBlair MacNeil\\n\\nYes, thanks, Irwin. And, yes, good question. In the industry overall, I would say dollar volume is, as Irwin just talked about, compressed by some of the growth in those categories. But dollar volume is up 4.5% to 5% overall. If you look at the KG shift or the volume overall, the category is growing at 9% to 10%. So we're still seeing healthy amounts of consumers come into the categories. We're seeing healthy amounts of growth in the business. I think what you're seeing is the offset of price compression.\\n\\nWhat we've made on choices that you heard in the results from Irwin and Carl, is to not play as aggressively in those distillate and distillate-infused categories, which are margin challenges. So overall, I would say the business is very healthy on the overall industry from a volume standpoint and a dollar volume standpoint still, growing at about 5% on the dollar side. And then on the Tilray side, we're being very choiceful in how we balance our margin and our volume.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nI think the big important thing here to realize is a couple things. Number one, you still pay a flat excise tax in Canada. You heard Carl say, we pay over $20 million in excise tax in a quarter. We pay close to $150 million for a full year. There's still definitely some price compression, but we're not going to play in areas where it's just all about price, and that's the big focus.\\n\\nThe other thing is, our teams have done a great job in taking costs out and getting the yields on our growth, getting the yields on our products, and educating consumers. They're going to have to pay a little more for the quality products they're getting.\\n\\nKaumil Gajrawala\\n\\nGot it. Useful. And then maybe just update on where we are on price compression and maybe the balance of supply?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo let me just come back and say this here. The interesting thing is you go back and look over the last three years, we probably in Canada lost well over $200 million on price compression. And not making excuses, that number drops to your bottom line. If you come back and look at ultimately excise tax being cut and it was half, there's an extra $50 million, $70 million.\\n\\nSo I think we're seeing price compression stabilize. In regards to inventories, with our growth today and our yields, and us ultimately balancing and rightsizing our facilities, I think we're in a great place today in regards to what our inventories are. And the market continues to change dramatically in regards to potency. And that is a big thing today. It's amazing.\\n\\nThey're looking for 30% plus potencies today. And if you can grow it, you can sell it. And I think that's what's important. And we got caught a little on potencies on our goods supply, and we saw some great growth in the quarter in regards to higher potencies in our goods supply brand.\\n\\nAnd the last thing, just let me add to it. It's five years now that cannabis is legal in Canada. Actually, it's five years, what, October 18 or something like that, coming up the anniversary. The consumer now is educated, and we've had to build these brands from scratch. So these brands were brands that have been built from scratch.\\n\\nGood Supply is over a [$200 million-plus] brand at retail. And the consumer there is educated today about quality, potency, genetics, and where the product comes from. And that's something Tilray has done an incredible job in making sure that we put great products out there. And listen, we still have a lot of restrictions in the packaging, how we advertise the products, how we communicate to our consumers.\\n\\nHi, good morning, and thank you for the question. So first, I just want to talk a high-level one in terms of how you're thinking about investing in the business and also driving profitable growth. You laid out a number of initiatives throughout the business. So I wanted to talk about how you're thinking about that and then EBITDA growth throughout the year, down a bit in the first quarter. So how best to think about the levers and the cadence of EBITDA and what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year. Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo number one, we come back, and this probably is one of our lowest quarters in the year. There's seasonality, which I don't think everybody looks at. There's also acquisitions, like in this quarter, there's nothing on the Molson Coors acquisition that we closed in early September. And in regards to rolling out new products, there's timing on that. In regards to our Delta-9 products in our beverage division, in regards to our non-alc, in regards to our Liquid Love, in regards to some of our other new products -- so again, there is seasonality and there's timing on a lot of new products in regards to the distribution of white space.\\n\\nThe other big thing that's not in here is a lot of the cost that we're still taking out of this business with the integration of the ABI brands. A lot of costs still coming out in regards to our Canadian business. And in Europe, there's a lot happening there with Germany. Our flower business was up since the announcement of the new regulations in flower Germany, almost 50%. There's a timing lapse of when we get products into the marketplace. There's a timing lapse of when products are shipped into the Poland market and some of the other ones. So a lot of it is just from a timing standpoint and the seasonality and our new products rolling out.\\n\\nAaron Grey\\n\\nOkay, thanks, Irwin. That's helpful color. Second question for me, just on the hemp-derived THC beverages, you laid out a number of states in your prepared remarks. You had previously said two states. I just want to clarify, those states in your prepared remarks, are those where you'll be distributing at brick-and-mortar or just DTC?\\n\\nAnd then secondly, just on hemp-derived beverages, how best to think about the ramping with brick-and-mortar, and the impact of bills that have been introduced, and the broader farm bill, which looks like it might be delayed another year, and how that's impacting broader distribution. Thank you.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo in regards to Delta-9, it's basically going to be brick and mortar. We've already received our first orders. And the majority of it will be rolled out into retailers and through our beer distributors that can sell it. Some will be definitely direct to consumer, but there's 19 states today that will allow this product.\\n\\nAnd we're pretty excited about the orders already and the demand for the product. And a lot more to come. We have five great products that we're going to roll out. So it will be basically sold at retail, these products, and through our beer distributors. Some will go through with our Happy Flower, will be direct to consumer.\\n\\nGood morning, everyone. I appreciate a lot of the commentary on sort of individual markets in Europe and how things are progressing on the regulatory front and even with respect to some demand. But I'm just curious, without getting too specific to the nitty-gritty of any numbers or anything -- but if you look at your international contribution, both exports, boots on the ground, it's been run rating at close to about $50 million for a little while now. And I'm just wondering if any of these changes on the regulatory front are expected to have a meaningful impact on that contribution by the end of your fiscal year.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo I'll let Denise jump in here for a second, but I got to tell you, you heard what I said. In Germany, since the changes in regulations, our flower business was up almost 50%. And in regards to supply -- and that's been some of our biggest constraints here, some supply. We supply from our Canadian operations. We supply from our Portugal, and some of the changes that we now have in Germany where we can sell out of our German facility where before we only could sell it through the German government.\\n\\nSo there's a lot of pieces in place. And listen, there's only 20 different countries that allow medical cannabis in Europe. And I think there's some tremendous opportunity to see the size of the categories in billions. The demand is there. Denise, do you want to add to what I said?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek\\n\\nYes, sure. Thanks, Irwin. And I do thank you for the question. I just want to challenge the one part about it running at $50 million for a few years now, because, actually, I think If you look back over the progression, we actually have seen pretty significant growth year over year. If you look basically from the point of time of the Tilray acquisition up until our reported numbers from last year, we're expecting very, very significant growth in this year's market.\\n\\nAs we look to our fiscal year '25, as Irwin mentioned, we had 50% growth in our flower business, 22% in our extract business, where we already have a sizable market share. We do have some -- as Irwin mentioned in the previous question, we have some timing with import-export permits receiving and certain countries where we ship directly to a distributor versus our own warehouses and therefore a servicing market through third-party distributors. So there will be some lumpiness, so it's really important to look at the business on a year basis, not necessarily on a quarter basis to get a full picture.\\n\\nMatt Bottomley\\n\\nOkay, got it. Appreciate all that. And then I just wanted, just more of a general question, but just given some of the growth headwinds in the domestic Canadian market, obviously, there's been a lot of attention paid. And you guys have done a lot of good strategic initiatives, whether it's international or beverage, alcohol. But on the wellness side of things, I'm just curious if there's any sort of M&A opportunities you think within there, or do you think this is more of a sort of organic growth story from the exposure you guys already have?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nWell, in regards to wellness, I think, listen, There's a lot of the medical in Canada that's coming over and they're going into recreational and buying it there. But medical is something that we're focused on. We see tremendous use for the product, whether it's anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy, so there's a big medical opportunity for us. Is there acquisitions for us in that area? That is an area that we are focused on in regards to the medical part of the business. But I think the whole thing is, again, is our research that we're focused on medical, which is a big commitment for us. and being the number one medical producer in Europe. There's a lot we're learning there and there's a lot as we work with universities and research that we're sharing back and forth. Matter of fact, we're in Europe next week with our Canadian teams and our European teams working on multiple things there. So yes, medical is a big part of our growth and medical is something that's very, very important to us in the Canadian market.\\n\\nThanks, Matt.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with Roth MKM. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nBill Kirk\\n\\nGood morning. I don't think I heard the fiscal 25 revenue guidance, which had been 950 million to a billion. Is that still the expectation for the year? And then if I recall, that guidance had included some M&A, some expectation for some M&A. Was the recent acquisition of the brands from Molson Coors the M&A that was contemplated in that guidance, or is there still more implied?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo that was the guidance for the year. There is some M&A in there. We have not updated our guidance to include the Molson's acquisition.\\n\\nBill Kirk\\n\\nOkay, so the range is still $950 million to $1 billion? Exactly. Okay. And then on the international side, I understand that it's up over a few years. It has been in that 11 million to 14 million on a per quarter basis for a little while, despite new positive developments. So what's offsetting the new positive developments on a more narrow timeframe?\\n\\nDenise Faltischek\\n\\nSo thank you for the question. The international business, basically, if you remember, we used to actually, there's been some ins and outs, I think, in terms of the business. So it's not exactly an apples to apples. If you recall a couple of years ago, Israel was actually a very big part of our revenue number. And if you might remember that it's been about a year and a half ago, two years ago, we discontinued our business in Israel. Just given the state of the market there, given the influx of products, the price compression, we just didn't feel that it was a profitable market for us to continue. So we discontinued those sales, which were quite sizable. However, in replacing that, we've sought out additional new countries. We entered Poland, we entered the UK, Italy, and Portugal. We've also identified a bunch of other countries which we will be entering, so stay tuned for that in future quarters. This business, as Irwin mentioned before, the Canadian business is just a few years old. The business in Europe is even more underdeveloped and immature at this point. And so in essence, it really is just starting to grow and take off now. And so I think it's still early innings for this business. We are very bullish about it going forward. And as I mentioned, we look to invest. We've already invested and we will continue to invest.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nI just think, again, you got to come back there's been some currency effect in Europe that affected us when you look at it. But, and Denise mentioned, as we look at this from a profitability, Europe is very profitable for us. and I think that's what's very important as we focus on profitability. The other thing is Germany being the biggest market there and we were restricted with our facility in Germany that we only could sell to the German government at a loss. That has changed. So we were losing money in regards to a tender that was awarded five years ago and we've been able to renegotiate that tender and renegotiate the terms of that. The second thing is, as each country legalizes, and we're not dealing with states here, we're dealing with different countries, with different regulatory, so building out the European market absolutely has been difficult, and there's markets that we've abandoned we are not selling into the Israeli market, which used to be one of the biggest markets of us. So what I can reassure you is, there's tremendous opportunities of growth We only really sell flower and tinctures. It's not like we're selling pre-rolls and we're selling multiple different products here. We're selling over 100 different products, but it's basically flower and tinctures and that's it. So we look for Europe to be a big opportunity. We are the largest grower of cannabis in Europe today. We have the infrastructure on the ground. taking a little time, but what's important to us is the profitability there. The other thing is we're vertically integrated with our CC pharma CC, our till rate pharma there in regards to distributing through the drug stores. So yes it's not growing as fast, but it is a very profitable business for us.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nMichael Lavery\\n\\nThank you. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to the Delta 9 beverages. It's been tough in the cannabis space, at least, really building brands that kind of parallel to how they've developed in other categories. And so this is an interesting case to see how it plays out. I guess with that in mind, you have four brands I think you mentioned you've got teed up and more come. Why so many and how do you plan to develop those and set them up for sustainable growth?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo number one, the brands are developed. And again, we've had happy flower out there for a long time with CBD. 420 is one of our brands that are known. You know, two or three of our other brands You know, have some uniqueness to them. So again, with our five different products out there, it gives us differentiation in products. It allows us to have multiple products out there. And so far, everything we have shown retailers, distributors, they've liked. And we've got quite a few orders. So yes, 420 is a brand that's well known out there. Happy Flower's been out there. We have to build some of our other brands out there, and we've done that before. As we've come out with new products in regards to Runner's High, which is our non-out there, Our Montauk non out there, our liquid love is our water brand that's coming out there. Our Delta 9, our new brand. Listen, the big thing is out there, we've got products. We've developed these flavors. We've developed these products from scratch. We've got 700 distributors out there and these distributors want it. Now, we only can sell it in the States as legal. and we got field sales people out there on the street that will make sure we get this product in the hands. But last but not least, which is important, how do we market that to the consumer? And that's what's important for us to make sure we're getting the message across to the consumer. There's some really good products that we're coming up with. Okay. Oh, sorry, go ahead. No, I just stopped, sorry.\\n\\nMichael Lavery\\n\\nOh, yes, no, so that's helpful. Just on some of the, you touched on some of the integration of beer production and how you've got more flexibility now. How significant can that be and how quickly could it come in terms of just, would we be right to think that you could consolidate some facilities or how do we just think about what to expect in the next several quarters for how that impacts your numbers?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo no good question there. Listen, we're in a category today where the craft beer industry is declining 3%. But there's $100 billion worth of beer sold out there. So it's not like a small category. So there is tremendous opportunities in the craft beer business, okay? And with that, we think we can go out there and take share with innovation with some of the new products that we've launched. We think we can back and look at whether it's the non-out The other thing is we're going back to each of our brands today. We have 19 brands out there, and we're looking at these brands, where they should be sold regionally, and what should be a national brand. Shock Top definitely should be a national brand. But if you take Montauk, you take Blue Point, and take SweetWater, and you focus them sort of in the Northeast. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, maybe Florida. That's over 100 million people that we can market our brands to. We don't need to be in every single state out there and ship 10,000, 20,000 cases there, spend money on it, where we're not going to get the lift. If you come back and look at SweetWater. SweetWater grew to a 2.5, 3 million case brand. But it went into certain states, whether it's Ohio or Illinois, that didn't make sense in those states, California. So what we're going to do is take these brands, focus on three, four, five states, put our money behind them, work with the distributors, educate the consumers about them, and then take our national brands, like a shop top, And the other thing that we're going to look at this here, if we have a pumpkin beer, we'll have pumpkin beer in similar flavors for Montauk, for Bluepoint. We're not going to have all these multiple different formulas out there with a lot of complexity. So we're looking at how we take our tail off our brands. We're looking at how to take complexity out of our business. We're going to do some skew rationalization. And with this, it will optimize and right-size our footprint. and the buying power today with over 15 million cases of beer that we're buying. And if we have to consolidate some of our facilities, which we're right now looking at, we ultimately will. But we really feel within a matter since 2020 we're now the fifth largest craft brewer out there with a 5% share out there. And we think we can get this category growing again through our innovation, through our distribution. And I got to tell you, working with distributors out there, they all want to see growth. They all want to see new innovation. They want to see products. And the same with the retailers. The retailers are looking at, there's way too many brands, way too many products. How do we ultimately get this category growing? Because it takes up too much space in stores.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic\\n\\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Irwin, maybe can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about US plant-touching assets? We've seen other companies that have ring-fenced structures Canopy USA, S&DL with SandStream, OGI has talked about that also. I mean there's been more consolidation and we would come to a point that there won't be much left to buy. So how do you handicap that and how do you think about doing something similar in the current context of regulation?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo I step back and listen. The good news is the two presidential candidates are in favor of legalization. And I think in regards to rescheduling, There's, in December, the recommendations are going to come up on that. So Pablo, I think something will happen in regards to rescheduling and something will happen in regards to federal legalization, whether it's medical cannabis that will be legalized and ultimately leave it up to the states for everything else. If you come back and look at what we can do, You know, remember, we've gone in, once Canada was legalized five years ago, they tell me it's six years ago, but I think it's still five, it was 2018, so I guess that is six years ago. If you come back and look at it, we built our Canadian business to a $300-plus million business from scratch. And we built growth facilities, we built brands, we built vertical integration, and today, as being one of the largest growers up there with almost 5 million square feet, we know how to grow cannabis. We know we have the genetic base. We know how to make pre-rolls. We know how to make tinctures. We know how to make drinks. We'll sell this year close to 9 million cans of cannabis-infused drinks. So we have the DNA. We have the know-how. We're one of the largest medical cannabis companies in Canada and in Europe. So with that, We're ready to do it on our own in the US depending upon what the guidelines and the parameters are. And on the other hand, with our balance sheet where it is today, we have the ability to go out and acquire a great strategic partner that can help us, if that makes sense. The other thing in the US today we have 18 beer brands or 19 beer brands. We have multiple brands. You know, in our spirits business, and we have our wellness brand in Manitoba Harvest, can these brands parlay over into the cannabis category, like we're doing with some of these in Delta 9? So again, I think with cannabis going to legalize, and that's my opinion, I have nothing else any other insight. We'll be ready to jump in to which way we can jump in there and be ready for it.\\n\\nPablo Zuanic\\n\\nThank you. And one last one maybe for Denise. Just going back to the discussion in Germany, maybe using some Michael Porter's terms here, but maybe remind us of your competitive advantage there, your competitive assets, your asset strengths. What are the barriers to entry? Because what I hear, there's all these licensed importers that are able to bring products. We saw a big jump, apparently, in imports in the second and third quarter. and then they are able to go to doctors, promote those products and sell them to the consumers. So I don't know if I want to see more fragmentation as opposed to consolidation in Germany, but I'm sure you have assets on the ground that give you an advantage. But I'm just trying to understand how the German market plays out in terms of fragmentation versus consolidation, just importers versus local producers. And what's your edge? And why should we assume that you are better positioned than others? If you can just mention that. And as part of that, a quick reminder, if you produce, if you jump production in Germany by five times I suppose that replaces Portugal or Canada, that doesn't mean that you end up with a higher cost structure. Thank you.\\n\\nDenise Faltischek\\n\\nThanks, Pablo. And thank you for the question. I think also I just want to also bring back to the previous question that was asked, because I think I was remiss in not stating the fact that if you look at our year-over-year growth between FY24 and FY23 in terms of the European market, we grew that market 34%. So I just wanted to actually finish off that last question, which I didn't do the last time. In terms of Germany, I think you are 100% right in terms of our unique positions in Germany and in Europe in particular. You mentioned our free RX facility with our ability under our newly issued license, we have the ability to produce to full capacity, which basically allows us to produce five times what we were able to produce under the tender. In addition, we expanded that license. Under the tender, we were permitted to produce three strains. Today, we now are able to do 31 cultivars, and I'm proud to say that actually what just landed at Norminster is a bunch of cultivars from our Canadian facilities where we look at cultivars that perform best in market in Canada, and we've shipped those cultivars over to both Portugal and a free Rx in order to provide ourselves with the maximum flexibility both in supply chain as well as the availability of products to patients. Having that facility as well as our Portugal facility as well as we've opened up the ability to deliver products from Canada, we have probably what I would classify as the most flexible supply chain of any cannabis company in Europe, where we see many of, and you mentioned about whether there's segmentation and consolidation, and as you know, there's a few larger players in the German market, and then there's a proliferation of a lot of smaller companies that are coming online and starting in the German market. I do think at some point there will be consolidation just because if you have a lot of players in a market, You will start to see consolidation of those players. But going back to our unique position, we have the most flexible supply chain, we have a great cost structure, given the work that we've done in order to make sure that we always keep our costs to produce very low and we're very efficient. In addition, we have a terrific first-class commercial team located in Europe and with boots on the ground in Germany. We have a sales team that is very well positioned in terms of their knowledge, their reputation with doctors, their reputation with government officials. And the fact of the matter being one of the first in Germany has given us a reputation of being trusted and having the expertise. So as doctors want to learn more and more about medical cannabis in light of the new regulations, We are one of the first that they seek out in order to get that information because they want to know how to prescribe and they want to know how to continue in the market.\\n\\nOur final question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\nRobert Moskow\\n\\nHi, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the quarterly results in beverage. I didn't hear whether you said that the sales were in line or a little below expectations. I think you said cannabis was in line or better. So can you just tell us how did beverage do versus you thought? The tracking data shows the brands are down a bit. Do they just need, like, is it a matter of timing before your new marketing efforts and your consolidation efforts take hold before the retail sales get a little bit better?\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nSo Robert, thank you. We don't give guidance out there about the image of businesses, but we have definitely internal guidance and internal budgets. The beverage business was off a bit, and a lot of that is just timing on some of the new products. And a lot of it is the products are ready. It's when the distributors ultimately take them. And that was the biggest thing. The other thing which you heard me talk about earlier is right-sizing the business here and going through our skew rationalization, going through our brand rationalization. and going through our distribution white space. Also, there's timing in regards to customers taking new products in products for Halloween, products pumpkin products and some of the different things like that. So just a timing standpoint. But the other one was integration of some of the ABI brands back into our facilities and supplies. So it's just from a timing standpoint. It's a timing standpoint if you look at our Our quarterly, if you look at our numbers here, our SG&A is way up in regards to our beverage business. But as we build out the infrastructure and build out people and take over the ABI business and do some of the spending, we expect to get the benefits from that over the year. So with that, we are excited to what we see that's happening out there. We think we're well positioned with our brands, with our products, with our innovation. Our customers are giving us good feedback. We have a lot of high hopes for Delta 9. We have a lot of high hopes for our non-out. We have a lot of hopes for our liquid love. We have a lot of hopes for some of the new innovation that's coming out under SweetWater, Montauk, and 10 Barrel. And which, again, which is not really in our numbers. with the acquisition that we just acquired the four brands from Molson Coors and getting our hands around them and seeing the growth opportunities with that. So with that, it's just early timing in regards to our beverage business, but there's a real, real, real good plan in place there, Robert.\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Simon for any final comments.\\n\\nIrwin Simon\\n\\nThank you very much, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. You know, I'm incredibly proud and excited of what we've been able to put together over the last five plus years. As you heard, our guidance out there is $950 to $1 billion a size. and that's coming from a startup basically at $50 million. Today we have over 44 brands. We have 2,700 people that work within the company today. We have plenty of facilities. We sell in over 20 countries, six different continents. And again, we are dealing in categories where regulation is important. There's no one company out there that does what we do as diversified as us. So it's not easy. And there's a lot of noise and a lot of news every day coming out about cannabis as we sit here and wait. There's a lot of changes that got to happen. But again, You know, the cannabis industry in the US is over 40-plus billion dollars in total size, so there's a big, big, big market out there. You know, you look at the total beer industry out there, the size just of the craft industry, there's a big business out there. You look at the wellness industry and some of the stuff that we're doing with Hampton Neck grew about 11% in a quarter. So we're well positioned. If you come back and look at our balance sheet, and that's something I think that's hurt a lot of other companies out there in the cannabis industry, is we really have managed our balance sheet, managed our cash situation, managed paying down debt. You know, in our last quarter, we paid down over $300 million of our convertible debt. So we're focused on this and pulling all this together. Are we totally happy with our stock performance? No. But I don't think it reflects of what this company has done over the last five years and how we put together some great brands, great people, a great strategy, and how we're diversified out there. And we're a global company in the CPG industry. So I feel there's exciting times ahead. You have great brands. You have a really committed team. We have a tight, tight strategy out there. We have great partners with our distributors, our retailers, our consumers who we're marketing to, and last but not least our aim is to please our shareholders and reward our shareholders. With that, thank you very much and enjoy your day. Go Mets, go Yankees, and you go to Citi Field, you'll find our beer, you go to San Diego, You'll find our beers. So we want stadiums that are in the playoffs that are selling our beers. So with that, be safe out there and thank you for joining us.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"The show begins with a focus on the kickoff of third-quarter earnings, highlighted by strong performances from major banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC). Keybank Chief Investment Officer George Mateyo joins to analyze how these results might set the tone for the rest of the earnings season, suggesting potential upside ahead.\\n\\nAttention then shifts to Tesla (TSLA), following investor disappointment with the company's recent robotaxi event. Financial adviser and YouTube personality Kevin Paffrath, discusses growing frustrations over Tesla's lack of focus on affordable electric vehicles. Yahoo Finance Reporter Akiko Fujita provides additional insights on Tesla's challenges in catching up to competitors like Waymo and Cruise in the autonomous driving sector.\\n\\nThe Good Buy or Goodbye segment features Barbara Doran, CEO and CIO of BD8 Capital Partners, LLC, who explains Uber's (UBER) dominant position in the rideshare market.\\n\\nThat's Josh Lipton live from our New York City headquarters.\\n\\nWe are giving you the ultimate investing playbook to help tune out the noise and make the right moves for your money.\\n\\nAnd here's headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour before the closing bell rings on Wall Street.\\n\\nIf you look on the last conference call, Elon Musk said that they would be in first production, um, you know, sometime next year.\\n\\nSo, you know, the event was, it was sort of like watching a movie with a lot of plot twists and, and special effects and at the end you're walking out kind of scratching your head.\\n\\nYou're talking it over with your friend, you know, trying to figure out what you just witnessed.\\n\\nA lot of managers earlier in the year had withdrawn from the large caps thinking we were headed for a recession.\\n\\nIt's not happening.\\n\\nEven though JP has built reserves, reserves are up over 100% year over year.\\n\\nThey're still not at a level where you're going to be terribly worried, they're normal compared to the COVID years.\\n\\nSo I think that overall JP is going to lead the pack back up as the large caps come back into favor with the manager before the print.\\n\\nWe were looking for about 0.25% of four BC.\\n\\nNow, it's looking like it could be a little bit hotter, which is higher than what the fed is looking for.\\n\\nSo if you take a step back, uh, we do think that the fed is able to, to cut at the next meeting, but it, it's a toss up and perhaps a bit higher than what the market is anticipating at the moment.\\n\\nLet's zero in on the S and P 500 for a second because it is set for its 45th record close of the year that gain that we're seeing today.\\n\\nAnd if you look at it on the week, it's also higher.\\n\\nIt is the fifth straight week that it's seeing gains.\\n\\nWe did have some economic data today and it didn't seem like it was anything to necessarily spoil the party.\\n\\nYeah, we got September PP I and I saw a columnist basically sum it up, you know, Julie your point saying, you know, not really far from what they expected.\\n\\nUm kind of showing some, you know, suggesting more progress on that front, on that end consumer confidence that did slip a bit.\\n\\nSo we know, you know, high prices inflation still top of mind for consumers there.\\n\\nAnd it was also the first decline in about three months.\\n\\nIt was unexpected to see that kind of a decline.\\n\\nBut to your point, a reminder that consumers are still very much paying attention to inflation cost of living.\\n\\nAnd so we'll see as we go through earnings and if that's going to be sort of more of a spoiler uh when it comes especially to consumer oriented companies.\\n\\nBut for today, what's really driving the gains that we're seeing on a sector basis is XL F. The financials today are gaining the most industrial is also doing pretty well, but the financials are big and that's because as we know a lot of these companies coming out with their earnings.\\n\\nJP Morgan Wells Fargo were kicking it off.\\n\\nUm In addition to hearing from some of the big asset managers, I'm just looking here for the banks here.\\n\\nThey are to get a bit more granular as to what we're saying, JB Morgan up 5% here.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo they reported obviously agree with good results.\\n\\nUm Interesting to note from Apollo Torsten Slack today, he kind of crunched the numbers Julie and saw that really financials are among those sectors just historically that do, in fact tend to outperform during a fed rate cutting cycle that ends in a soft landing.\\n\\nI think you mentioned health care, consumer staples staples as well there.\\n\\nI think already you see investors in the street trying to sort of extrapolate for read throughs to next week when the party continues.\\n\\nYes or not.\\n\\nWe'll figure out how these different banks are playing the decline in rate.\\n\\nYeah, for sure.\\n\\nFor more on this banks kick it off another earnings season with JP Morgan.\\n\\nWell, Fargo Bank in New York Mellon all reporting solid quarterly results.\\n\\nBut how long will good times last as lower rates make their way through the financial system for more reaction today's earnings.\\n\\nWe're gonna bring in David Ellison portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.\\n\\nUh, those banks, they reported results, Dave, give me your take on those results.\\n\\nWe did anything surprise you, Dave in those reports.\\n\\nUh, not really.\\n\\nI think, I think fundamentally they're pretty much in line with what, what everybody thought, uh which was sort of, uh, a no news quarter in terms of credit and margins.\\n\\nI think the, the issue is that, uh, the big thing is rates have stopped going up and so they're coming down a bit, taking pressure off deposits that's helping margins.\\n\\nCredit's fine.\\n\\nBut I, I think the, the big thing is the mathematics of the business is working in their favor for uh the first time in a while, meaning that they're growing tangible equity, they're buying back stock and the, and the book value is growing.\\n\\nSo, Jp Morgan had an 18% year over year growth and tangible book.\\n\\nNow, that's being helped obviously by earnings and being helped by the recovery or the decline in rates, which is helping the, the hit on, on, on asset uh that they had.\\n\\nSo then that's gonna continue.\\n\\nSo the point is that you're you're growing book value at that rate, it's gonna continue to grow roughly at that rate.\\n\\nYou could argue that's the same thing for a lot of the other banks.\\n\\nObviously, the numbers will be different, but we haven't been in a situation where book value has been growing for a while.\\n\\nAnd uh I think that's a, a big part of what's happening here.\\n\\nUh I think 2nd, 2nd thing is, let's remember now, JP Morgan is a $4 trillion bank.\\n\\nUh The Fed's balance sheet is only seven now uh down from nine ish.\\n\\nUm So the point being is that the banks are becoming a much bigger part of how the Fed is going to fund the government and how the treasury is going to fund the government and that's a value creator for them.\\n\\nAnd you throw on the fact that the markets at all time.\\n\\nHighs Wall Street is open, they're generating a lot of fees.\\n\\nSo th this is a bank that is, you know, poised to be, become a very important player in the financial system worldwide, uh, and be a partner with the Fed and not be sort of run over by the Fed.\\n\\nSo I think tho those are the things that I see is that, you know, the Fed is shrinking, the banks are getting bigger and be, and because of that more important and more profitable because of it, Dave to get back to net interest income for just a minute and zero in on that.\\n\\nNot just for JP Morgan Wells Fargo having sort of a similar experience, as you mentioned, with rates going down with the fed cutting rates, it means that these banks have to pay out less on deposits, but at the same time, they're collecting less on loans and there were some questions going into this quarter, how that was gonna sort of balance out?\\n\\nDoes that, is that too balancing out in the bank's favor and not just these two banks, but the ones we're gonna hear from next week.\\n\\nWell, it's in their favor as long as rates don't go down too much.\\n\\nI mean, if we, well, too much would be to get, let's say down to, you know, 2% or 1.5% or, or below 2% in fed funds because then your prime is gonna be five or four and that's no good.\\n\\nUm, a and, and so I think that, you know, I know we're picking numbers but, but I think it's, you know, a 3 4% cost of funds and a 56 7% yield on assets is kind of the sweet spot.\\n\\nAnd the, the hope is that you can stay there.\\n\\nThe other thing is that, you know, the banks have gone through a significant increase in rates and therefore loss of, of market value that's coming back and they're gonna reposition and not want to go through that again.\\n\\nSo, but I don't, I don't think it's all about n I think, I think there is, you know, there is the structure of the deposits which, you know, everybody worried about with Silicon Valley and that's still out there.\\n\\nAnd so it's not so much the cost of your deposit.\\n\\nIt, it's the structure and where is the next deposit gonna come from?\\n\\nDave?\\n\\nWhat, what are some of the, the read throughs for you from these reports to next week when more big names are on deck.\\n\\nI mean, what's, what's happening to the goose is happening to the gander and we can argue that, you know, it may be a little different, you know, somebody have, may have some credit issues here and there, somebody may have lower margins, but we're all fishing in the same pond.\\n\\nWe all have roughly the same, meaning the banking industry all makes loans, roughly at the same rate.\\n\\nThey take deposits roughly at the same rate.\\n\\nIt's a, it's a, a homogenized national market which obviously, you know, wasn't the case when I started, uh, you know, back in the eighties, uh, which seems like forever ago.\\n\\nBut, um, uh, you know, I think now it's a question of execution and it's, it's a question of being big enough to be competitive, not only with, you know, with Black Rock or with, you know, Blackstone or, or, you know, or with what's going on internationally, but to be competitive with the Fed and in terms of their size and their ability so that you want them to invest in the future, you want to invest in their business and not just sit there and worry about the margin every day because that's a boring business that nobody really wants anymore.\\n\\nDave to, to take a little bit of a left turn on, on another note.\\n\\nI, I do wanna ask you about Bank of America specifically because we learned today that Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the bank has now fallen to below 10%.\\n\\nSo we won't be learning, you know, on a sort of regular basis if there are more sales.\\n\\nUm What do you make of, of this change in ownership at B of A?\\n\\nIs it something that worries you at all.\\n\\nAs an investor, I know you hold both of these stocks by the way, uh in your portfolio.\\n\\nUh I don't, you know, I really don't think it matters that much.\\n\\nUh, at the end of the day, the fundamentals of bank America are gonna drive where the stock's gonna go.\\n\\nUh, you know, Berkshire didn't make the stock, you know, go to five bucks in the financial crisis and it certainly didn't make it go to $40 when it bought it.\\n\\nSo II I think, you know, everybody, you know, is interested in that and it's sort of nice news, but at the end of the day, if the Bank of America comes out with a good quarter, the stock's probably gonna go up regardless of what, what Berkshire does.\\n\\nBye bye while Big Banks kicked off earnings season today with beats across the board.\\n\\nExpectations for overall earnings growth in the third quarter do remain pretty modest here.\\n\\nAccording to data from fact, that Wall Street's estimating 4.7% increase in earnings.\\n\\nThat is a big deceleration from last quarter before an expected rebound to end the year for more on what to expect this earnings and the implication for stocks.\\n\\nWe want to welcome in George Matteo.\\n\\nKey Bank chief Investment Officer, George is good to see you.\\n\\nSo indeed, in the second quarter, we saw S and P earnings up 11% the forecast for this quarter, 4.7%.\\n\\nHow do you think that is going to sort of play out?\\n\\nHow will companies do versus expectations and will stock still be able to rally?\\n\\nYeah, great to you as well.\\n\\nAnd I think you're right to note that earnings, uh, this, this quarter are currently pretty, uh, I guess, miles of price in terms of expectations.\\n\\nYou know, I think we kind of noted that there was a deceleration from the prior quarter.\\n\\nThis actually will mark the fifth consecutive quarter of positive year over year earnings growth.\\n\\nAnd that's really something we shouldn't sneeze at more importantly, in our view, we think that extra earnings will end up a lot higher than the 4% rate they pay up for right now.\\n\\nWhy is that typically actual earnings have exceeded its forecast 37 of the past 40 quarters, the three quarters in which they didn't exceed the expectations were March of 2020 and the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2022 in that environment, we, of course, we had the COVID pandemic in 2020 then the fed in 2022 was aggressively raising interest rates.\\n\\nEither one of those is with us today.\\n\\nSo as we think of this about this quarter, we think it's fair to say that on average, roughly 80% of the companies typically beat expectations and this quarter set it up to be the similar dynamic where we think most companies will actually exceed expectations.\\n\\nAnd by the time we get done with it quarterly, we think we're poised, renew growth of close to seven or maybe 8% not just 4%.\\n\\nAs you look through Q three through Q three, George.\\n\\nAnd I think our view is a little bit more nuanced in the sense that as we think about the back half of this year, your chart was very illustrative in the sense that as we think about the back half of this year and the next year, the bar does get set higher.\\n\\nSo we kind of see bte earnest growth for much of next year, but that's a pretty high bar to jump over.\\n\\nSo I would think that maybe in a so long as the economy continues to grow, as long as it continues to see moderate inflation, we can still see pricing pressure pushing through in terms of top line growth and also some cost cutting that will allow earnings to come as well.\\n\\nSo I think the bar set higher but remains, we've seen whether or not it's too high as we approach the next year and earnings beyond that too.\\n\\nAnd so as we come up on the two year anniversary of the bull market, and you're looking at this backdrop for earnings, where do you think we go from here do you think the bull market gets extended?\\n\\nAre earnings the catalyst or are you watching something else that is gonna continue to push that, that movement upward?\\n\\nWell, I think we're still in this kind of mid cycle environment where right now we've got decent rate growth overall.\\n\\nAs you mentioned, we've got a pretty good economy.\\n\\nWe've got labor market, which is still pretty strong and we also have a gen just a general easing of inflation.\\n\\nNow, this week, we got probably more noise than news with respect to the inflation number.\\n\\nSo I don't think we learned too much on the inflation side, but generally, we see inflation moderating and in that backdrop, we continue to see that risk assets are somewhat attractive, one of the flies in the orbit, however, is the fact that valuations are today rather full at 22 times forward earnings relative to 15 times earnings at the start of this bull market.\\n\\nSo we would not be surprised to see some other pull that perhaps in the near term, we saw a lot to digest with especially political noise as well.\\n\\nBut if you actually your actually your playbook plays out, we think there's a good chance that we may be going to pause, we could see further gains at the rest of your place out into next year as well.\\n\\nWhat do you think the market reaction and response would be to that.\\n\\nWell, it's a great question.\\n\\nI think there's a lot to cover a lot of ground to cover between now and then.\\n\\nUh most notably is another employment report.\\n\\nAnd if it's a strong one, maybe it would suggest the fed would, would likely pause that said it would really kind of take some strong economic data to kind of get the fed.\\n\\nProbably off the silent onto the silence, I should say again.\\n\\nAnd if that happens again, I think the market would probably rejoice the fact that the overall labor market is still pretty strong and the recession um scenario is really off the table at that point.\\n\\nUm What kind of sectors are you looking at right now?\\n\\nWe really want to be in quality companies that trade at reasonable valuations.\\n\\nWe let companies that have strong balance sheets and really generate her around capital and how we're trying to invest capital.\\n\\nMore specifically, we also think it's important to look at companies that really are kind of poised to benefit from this mid cycle phenomena that we talked about earlier.\\n\\nSome of those companies reside in a cyclical sector.\\n\\nBut again, focus on companies that have highly balance sheets.\\n\\nWe like certain names and energy and materials and also financials just based on your I guess comments.\\n\\nWe still think that the bank had some room to run as well.\\n\\nAnd I think it really deserves some representation in every portfolio.\\n\\nWe're a bit more picky though, with respect to the certain names of technology we like, uh we think certain names are probably poised for a bit of a pause.\\n\\nWe also see the market broaden out and by that, I mean, beyond this magnificent seven.\\n\\nSo we think there's gonna be broader participation as well.\\n\\nAnd then finally, we also like healthcare for its defensive growth, posture elements as well.\\n\\nWe're just getting started here on market domination coming up.\\n\\nTesla shares hitting reverse today after the company's long awaited robot tax even failed to impress investors.\\n\\nSo what's next will break it down on the other side and at 330 it's the latest edition of our series.\\n\\nGoodbye or goodbye.\\n\\nWe'll take a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best move for your portfolio.\\n\\nStay tuned, more market domination still to come.\\n\\nUm Tesla shares are sliding today after the company's long awaited Robo Taxi event failed to impress investors.\\n\\nCeo Elon Musk said the company hopes to be producing the cyber cab before 2027 but he didn't offer any details on where the cars will be manufactured.\\n\\nHe added that consumers would be able to buy a Tesla cyber cab for under $30,000 by and large even big Tesla bows on the stock said they wanted more details.\\n\\nAnd one of those bulls is Adam Jonas over at Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nOf course, he still says it's a top pick, right?\\n\\nHe still loves the stock, but he said it didn't meaningfully advance the narrative of Tesla as an A I company.\\n\\nHe said he was disappointed the substance and detail of the presentation and he says he expects it to continue to be under pressure here.\\n\\nAnd really what it seems he and other analysts wanted was again that more granular detail.\\n\\nYou know, these guys like to dive in and get technical and they did not indulge them, they wanna, they wanna make a model out of this, which is that he, he here's another theory which I have, which is that I know that that was definitely the theme, right?\\n\\nWell, you know where, where's the meat?\\n\\nI want more details, more numbers, I want more time lines, especially on the street.\\n\\nHow am I supposed to model vision and marketing and branding?\\n\\nI also wondered how much of that stock reaction today.\\n\\nUm I mean, you can see that we're down 8% here was also because they didn't get any info on that lower price model.\\n\\nAnd I went right because I thought it was interesting when we talked to shareholders leading into that event, we talked to Ross Gerber, right?\\n\\nAnd we, we, we, we were kiting with Ross about, about Robo Taxi.\\n\\nBut then we asked Ross, what if you got Ross some info, some news on that lower price and his eyes lit up.\\n\\nHe didn't think it was likely, wow, that would jump off the screen with that.\\n\\nOne is that for this being a company where Elon Musk has said, don't buy us because we're a car company, buy us because we're an autonomous and A I company, the stuff that they showcased her was not all autonomous.\\n\\nAnd again, Adam Jonas in his note points out that the, the van, the Robo van, he says it's not clear of this vehicle, vehicle or the cyber cab, we're operating fully autonomously on the closed course.\\n\\nHe says the same of the optimist robots that might have been remotely controlled.\\n\\nSo, you know, so there was if you're trying to make your name as an autonomous company and the stuff that you're showing is for the show, I will say there were a couple bulls out there who were pleased with the event.\\n\\nIt will not surprise you to know that one of them was Mr Dan Ives over at Wedbush who said that last night, the event was a glimpse of the future of Tesla and next generation transportation for consumers.\\n\\nHe said it's the inflection point for Tesla from an EV maker to this bigger thing that Musk is trying to build.\\n\\nThe robots did get a lot of attention.\\n\\nThey really did dancing, people serving drinks that looked like I will say though there was uh you know, venture investor, Josh Wolf saying on X here's what he said about the robots.\\n\\nHe said not at all.\\n\\nA I totally worthy to celebrate low latency remote control, but totally dishonest to demo these as autonomous robots.\\n\\nI I love it in the tech world when low latency remote control.\\n\\nNow joining us now, Kevin Path financial advisor and youtuber meet Kevin Kevin.\\n\\nI know you were watching that event very closely as well.\\n\\nNow you still have some Tesla in a retirement account.\\n\\nUm If so as an investor looking at that event last night, do you go out there and buy on this dip that you're seeing today?\\n\\nWell, it is so tempting.\\n\\nFirst of all, thank you for having me, but it is so tempting because when you see it down 8% day logic says by, but the reality that we have to think about is look, if we're soft landing and the US economy is going to be great for the next 10 years.\\n\\nThis is the perfect vision that you want.\\n\\nThis is the 2021 kind of vision that just takes stocks through the roof because everybody's got the Cathy Wood five year time horizon and don't get me wrong.\\n\\nI love Cathy, but I'm really worried because Tesla just gave up its midterm recession protection.\\n\\nYou got to think that the people who buy Teslas are mostly 25 to 40 year old guys in finance and tech and they are the ones that have the biggest risk of losing their job from A I and the biggest risk of having hardship finding a new job.\\n\\nYou are already at flat year, over year growth, you're plummeting in Europe in terms of growth, which happens to be where one of your Giga factories are.\\n\\nUh the Wall Street actually was the financial times just showed uh Germany and potentially a two year recession.\\n\\nAnd so now you're in a place where you don't have a new product to help you survive the medium term.\\n\\nWhy not introduce the cyber cab as for sale with the steering wheel, wheel and pedals and it says fleet eligible in the future with the new hardware five and you could drive it with your steering wheel like normal.\\n\\nYou know, it'll be, be fleet eligible and you can remove that hardware in the long term.\\n\\nThat way Tesla could start mass producing these next year and actually generate some eps growth that's substantial to justify this high valuation.\\n\\nSo we're you, um you know, we, we talked about this uh Kevin with some other shareholders.\\n\\nI'm not saying they were expecting that Elon Musk was gonna make some news at the event with lower price models, but they were really hoping for that.\\n\\nUh I thought if they didn't introduce a lower cost model that could be bought for the midterm, I thought that this, this essentially would happen and it could potentially start a downtrend.\\n\\nI was really hoping that they would have learned that when they, when the rumors from Reuters circulated that, oh, we're not doing the model too and the stock tanked in the spring, I would have thought logic would have told them, ok, the shareholders, what a cheaper car just give it to them if you can mass manufacture and you're such an expert in manufacturing, manufacture these cars, even if you're only going to do so for five or six years before Robotaxis take over, have that bridge to get you through a recession because now what you've got are existing models and hope and not much in between that doesn't help you in a recession and you are also right on to point out what Adam Jonas said, which is exactly what I thought uh at the event yesterday as well, the robots that were probably bolted to the ground and dancing in the gazebo that nobody could get close to.\\n\\nThose were preprogrammed.\\n\\nLikely the robots that are walking around doing handshakes or playing rock paper scissor with folks.\\n\\nThose are all very likely tele operated.\\n\\nIn fact, there was someone from Microsoft apparently on Twitter who was suggesting they asked and that they were tele operated.\\n\\nIt's very likely that the Robo Taxis were not using the FSD that we use on the road.\\n\\nIt was some form of preprogrammed circuit on private roads, which means you don't have A I there and the Robo van was closer to the ground than China's economy, which means one pothole takes that thing out.\\n\\nYeah, we had a little oopsies and, and we messed up our fertility timing and we ended up, that's probably more than we need to know.\\n\\nThat's probably more than we need to know, but that's ok. Um That is amazing.\\n\\nThat's an amazing fact to know that.\\n\\nSo listen it seems, uh, you know, it seems obvious the way that you're laying out the way that a lot of these analysts have laid it out that this would be disappointing.\\n\\nWhy do you think that the company didn't realize it needed to deliver more or is it just because that's worked for Tesla historically to, to go by this playbook?\\n\\nWell, I honestly, I think it's, uh, just sort of typical Elon character and, and I don't actually see that as a long term flaw.\\n\\nI think a visionary is typically going to be very stubborn about what they believe the future is.\\n\\nAnd I think that Elon is, is correct.\\n\\nThe future is dry, the future is everything he is doing.\\n\\nHe, he is so right about the future and I couldn't support him more.\\n\\nJust the, uh, it's a little bit of a slap in the face and potentially a recession when you've got the or near recession when the fed is flying so close to the sun that they cut 50 yields tighten by 50.\\n\\nUh, you, you're really tightening this economy a lot and Tesla is an interest rate, sensitive stock with customers that are going to be most impacted if we go into recession.\\n\\nSo I think the business side failed here, the innovation side and the vision I'm all for it.\\n\\nDo I think some of it was probably more show than real technology, technology.\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nBut honestly, it was an exciting event for the vision and it may be excited about wanting to be part of the stock more and investing in it.\\n\\nBut honestly, I'll wait for like a 150 or maybe even a one hand, a 1 100 handle on the stock before reinvesting Kevin.\\n\\nI, I'm curious if, if the future is driverless.\\n\\nDo you think Tesla, do you think Elon Musk has uh certain competitive, competitive advantages in that market in that race to that future?\\n\\nSo the answer to that is sort of two folded.\\n\\nThe answer cur currently like in a snapshot today is absolutely Tesla has a massive lead.\\n\\nBut the irony that I think a lot of folks forget is that the better chip sets like Nvidia's Blackwell or even the H one hundreds get the better these chip sets get the easier it is for other companies to use Nvidia's Drive platform or other platforms and their compute to use less data, substantially fewer miles than Tesla has driven and end up getting similar results.\\n\\nSo interestingly, you're up against the clock.\\n\\nYou know, I, I first got autopilot from Tesla seven years ago and I bought it because I thought it was the greatest thing ever and I loved it.\\n\\nI've been using it for seven years, but I remember 70 years ago thinking, wow, I won't have to drive in three years.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nWell, now my two year old is nine and I'm still driving and I'm still taking over at knucklehead intersections that FSD just can't read the road signs on and it wants to do silly things.\\n\\nIt's getting further and fewer in between.\\n\\nBut the reality is that Moat Tesla has, is shrinking and it's shrinking fast.\\n\\nWell, and Kevin to your point, I mean, you know, we're not quite there yet but maybe, you know, sooner than you're gonna get a Tesla van to stick all of your, your family in, you're gonna get a Waymo maybe to stick your family in.\\n\\nWell, I think you're right.\\n\\nI think in the longer term, this the vision that Tesla is trying to pitch is hey, uh everybody's going to be able to submit these vehicles to this sort of robo taxi network.\\n\\nHonestly, I think in the future if we're going to have Robotaxis driving around, I, I'm gonna be brand agnostic as a consumer, an enthusiast, the Tesla investor is going to want the T Tesla, but everybody else is gonna open up an Uber or whatever.\\n\\nThey don't care if it's a Waymo.\\n\\nIf it's a cruise, if it's a Tesla, they just want it to show up faster and cheaper.\\n\\nAnd so I think that pricing power in the long term really wanes because I mean, you see it today and I'm sure we've all done it.\\n\\nYou open up Uber, what, 10 minutes away.\\n\\nUh Let me go on lift and if that's three minutes away, I have zero loyalty to that Uber.\\n\\nI feel bad about that, but that's going to be how most consumers act.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, that's just gonna create a race to the bottom in terms of margins.\\n\\nI don't actually see Robo Taxi as, as profitable as people suggest.\\n\\nElon Musk has said full self driving software will be available as soon as next year.\\n\\nBut that still puts Tesla well behind its competitors who already operate autonomous taxis.\\n\\nAkiko Fujita joins us now with a closer look at why Tesla has trailed in its robo taxi ambitions.\\n\\nAkiko, hey there, Josh, you have to understand the competitive landscape.\\n\\nYou don't need to look further than the roads here in Los Angeles where I am or Google's Waymo operates thousands of autonomous taxi rides every day.\\n\\nThe city is one of four Waymo cities that Waymo currently operates in logging an average of more than 100,000 paid rides per week.\\n\\nWe should point out Tesla doesn't have any right now.\\n\\nSoftware is the biggest challenge to achieving what is considered full autonomy and to truly understand how far Tesla technology lags behind its competitors as it stands.\\n\\nNow, there's a number of data sets that you can look to the number of driverless miles logged.\\n\\nWemo has 22 million riders uh rider only miles gm's cruise which was suspended last year.\\n\\nOf course, after an accident has more than 5 million miles.\\n\\nAnd Tesla's technology today still requires human supervision.\\n\\nThe other measure that engineers point to is the distance these cars can go before requiring human intervention either because of a potential accident or because of confusion.\\n\\nData from California DMV shows Waymo cruise and Amazon Zs which by the way hasn't launched yet.\\n\\nThey were able to go thousands of miles without the need for human intervention.\\n\\nA recent test by independent research firm A MC I drove 1000 miles using Tesla's existing software and found that a human needed to intervene every 12 to 13 miles.\\n\\nMusk defended Tesla's technology yesterday and said drivers will experience full autonomy next year.\\n\\nSo supervised for self, full self driving is actually working quite well for I'm sure there's people in the crowd.\\n\\nYou, you're using that.\\n\\nUh Yeah, so it we we'll move from supervised full self-driving to uns unsupervised, full self-driving where the car you could, you could fall asleep and wake up at your destination as for why Tesla lags its competitors.\\n\\nEngineers, I've been speaking to point to the company's approach, unlike Weo and Zs, which relies on a suite of sensors, including lidar cameras and MICS.\\n\\nTesla relies on a camera based vision system which is seen as more affordable Phil Coopman who is a Carnegie Mellon professor who studies autonomous vehicle safety.\\n\\nTells me Tesla's approach is akin to tying one hand one hand, I should say behind your back.\\n\\nTesla has also opposed geo fencing which establishes virtual borders for cars to operate in Coopman says that's critical to autonomous taxis today because it allows operators to restrict certain functions in the vehicle, in certain areas to enhance safety.\\n\\nBut guys, I I heard you talking to the previous guest about what exactly is the Tesla advantage of Tesla is so far behind in the thing that analysts repeatedly point to is the fact that Tesla has scale.\\n\\nIt is not a cheap proposition here to operate these robo taxes.\\n\\nIf Tesla can get the software right, then they have the ability to scale up significantly and bring the price down.\\n\\nThe question is whether they will reach that point.\\n\\nAnd of course, you've had many guests on asking questions about that today.\\n\\nThank you, Kiko, appreciate it coming up.\\n\\nWhich of the ride sharing giants should you be investigating?\\n\\nWe're taking a deeper dive into Uber and Lyft in the latest edition of our series.\\n\\nOur goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio today.\\n\\nHailing with its fully autonomous robot taxi could shake up the competitive landscape when it comes.\\n\\nSo what's the best way to play the space?\\n\\nI'm here with Barbara Duran B A capital partner con Cio, you're back with us.\\n\\nFirst of all, it is Uber and Uber has already done pretty well over the past year.\\n\\nIt's up about 80% or so you can see on this chart.\\n\\nSo let's get to why you still like it here, even as we have the emergence maybe of a competitor coming down the road in a Tesla.\\n\\nBut, you know, they've got dominant market share and they're just growing their share, they're about 76%.\\n\\nYou know, uh Lyft, which is the only real competitor in the space is at about 23%.\\n\\nAnd Uber, you know, really, because they have a diversified uh business with the ride sharing and the food delivery really in a way lucked out with and during COVID because everything was shut down, Lyft was shut down in the ride sharing.\\n\\nEverybody was, but they had the food delivery which really picked up.\\n\\nSo when things opened up again, they were well positioned financially so they could really take off.\\n\\nAnd I think you've really seen a big difference since then, you know, and so much comes down in ride sharing is timeliness that you don't have to wait 10 minutes where you can get a competitor who's like a minute and also pricing.\\n\\nBut I think that's been the real difference in why they've continued to gain share.\\n\\nAnd they've also introduced all these customer friendly, um, Uber one.\\n\\nAnd they continue to expand on the food delivery trying to go after alcohol and convenience and grocery store deliveries.\\n\\nWell, le let's talk first about the autonomous vehicle idea here.\\n\\nUm You think what we heard last night from Tesla shows that competition is not around the corner for?\\n\\nI think, I think that's exactly what it shows because the stock was under pressure for the last four months, but waiting for this big event because nobody quite has figured out and I think people are figuring out where the A V the autonomous vehicles are gonna fit into a business like an Uber or even a Lyft.\\n\\nAnd I think last night, first for is for, as Tesla is concerned, production is not gonna start until 26 maybe 27 and they'll be, there's already Waymo who's doing 100,000 rides a week.\\n\\nBut having said that if they would it make sense for them or Waymo to start a business on their own in terms of ride sharing.\\n\\nAnd the fact is it looks like partnership is a smarter way to go.\\n\\nAnd that's, we've had Uber partnering with Waymo and Cruz and some, several others.\\n\\nBut the big one emerging seems to be Waymo where they've already been doing, um sharing in Phoenix and now they're about to roll out in Austin and Atlanta with Waymo, but with a difference and this is gonna be an early 25 what they're gonna do is start to do fleet management for Waymo because you look at how expensive it is.\\n\\nThose cars on average are probably 100 and $50,000 to make, you know, and that's because of all the electronics and all that and then they'll have to be maintained and charged and, you know, and also it's very capital intensive.\\n\\nAnd right now, Uber and Uber and Lyft of the world are capital light, which is great.\\n\\nSo what the deal is coming coming forward is that um we will have the advantage of all their um logistics and the power of their um platform, which is they have some 67 million drivers around the world.\\n\\nThey have 100 million active users a month, you know.\\n\\nSo, and to recreate that if you are an A V, that'd be tough to replicate.\\n\\nIt will be something that supplements and it should obviously benefit.\\n\\nUm, Uber because then eventually you don't have to pay drivers.\\n\\nSo it's a, it's an inter very interesting developments.\\n\\nDo you think that they're gonna beat Tesla to scale in that 2627 time frame in a Waymo?\\n\\nIt looks like it.\\n\\nI mean, they're already out there and they're planning to roll out and they have, you know, hundreds of thousands millions of hours of driving and they have a perfect safety record.\\n\\nI don't think Tesla has a perfect safety record in terms of even just using, you know, um automated uh equipment in their own cars that are with drivers.\\n\\nSo I think that it's gonna be tough for them to catch up.\\n\\nLet's get to that cash flow point that you talked about that the balance sheet for Uber is also looking good as you said, it's an asset light model.\\n\\nYeah, it is.\\n\\nAnd you know, it was uh for a long time in, in getting to profitability, but they finally achieved it in second quarter of 23.\\n\\nAnd right now, they've got about 6/6 billion on the balance sheet.\\n\\nTheir free cash flow is huge at 1.7 billion.\\n\\nAnd they've also authorized a $7 billion share buyback time unknown, maybe it's over 2 to 3 years.\\n\\nBut that's showing a lot of confidence that they can really continue to generate this free cash flow.\\n\\nI mean, that's something that has affected Uber in the past.\\n\\nAnd I'd say until, you know, until yesterday, people really thought the big risk was that, you know, the A VS could come in and eventually displace them.\\n\\nI don't really think that's gonna happen.\\n\\nSo right now, you know, it will always be a risk for the Ubers of the world.\\n\\nWhat happens with consumer spending and right now it looks like consumer spending has been amazingly resilient.\\n\\nWe're on, the fed is just embarking on an easing cycle.\\n\\nWe don't know, you know, how much or when, but it looks like maybe another 50 or half a percentage point by year end.\\n\\nAnd so if the consumer keeps spending, you know, they'll still be doing Uber rides, they'll still be doing um take out and home delivery.\\n\\nSo that, that is the risk though.\\n\\nIf the consumer starts to pull back, let's look at the flip side of all of this and that is lift those shares are also up over the past year, about 20%.\\n\\nBut you really prefer Uber and it's mostly uh in comparison, right?\\n\\nThat, that Lyft doesn't look right here.\\n\\nYou, you talk about it that it's just not as profitable and it's smaller, right?\\n\\nAnd it's not that Lyft is assured because Lyft got new management team in, in 23 in the f in the first half of the year, a new CEO, a new CFO and they've really worked, they get rid of like two or three layers of management and they are really worked on operating efficiencies going after profitability.\\n\\nSo just this last quarter, they finally generated positive free cash flow.\\n\\nThey finally had a profit and the management is determined to do it and the ridership things are looking good, but it's gonna be very tough, you know, because you've got the virtuous circle going with Uber in a big way, you know, you get more drivers because there's more passengers, there's more demand and that just keeps escalating up.\\n\\nAnd Lyft and also Uber's worldwide is only in US and Canada and I'm sure they're thinking about international, but will they have the funds?\\n\\nI mean, the free cash flow is very helpful, you know, to do that.\\n\\nBut right now their debt to equity ratio is something like 100 and 90%.\\n\\nThat's pretty big.\\n\\nThat doesn't allow a lot of room for error or a lot of room for maneuvering as well.\\n\\nSo let's also talk about the how the stock tends to do.\\n\\nThis is not responding to me as we would like, but the stock underperforms when you look at it versus, um, versus, uh, Uber, it just doesn't tend to do as well.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAnd I think that really reflects the fundamental difference in the two names.\\n\\nYou know, you mentioned that, that it's up like 20% but Uber is up like four times that over the last year and year to year to date from January 1, Lyft is actually down, you know, it's down 10% where Uber is up 37%.\\n\\nAnd then if, even if you look back three years, five years, if you go back three years, I think Lyft is down 75 plus percent, whereas Uber is up, you know, in over 60% and the same kind of stats for five years.\\n\\nSo I think that performance tells you a lot.\\n\\nUm, what could go right for Lyft, you've sort of alluded to it already, this new management team reinvigorating it sort of getting some momentum.\\n\\nAnd I think they can continue to improve you because in the major markets where they have enough density, you know, of cars, you know, they are pretty competitive but they don't have a lot of room, you know, to try to take share, they said they're taking share, you know, but I don't know about that.\\n\\nAnd, uh, because to take share, they would have to cut prices, they have to really be even faster to the customer.\\n\\nAnd that's hard right now, you call an Uber and you've probably got a choice of four or five.\\n\\nSo, you know, I think they continue to, to work their way up.\\n\\nAnd so the company, if they can maintain that profitability, the stock should do.\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nBut you're looking at a difference estimates, um going forward about 8% revenue growth where as you're seeing Uber growing at about 16% revenue growth and that looks to continue and then even on earnings on Uber, I mean, it's amazing, but um analysts are projecting 40 plus percent for the next few years in earnings growth.\\n\\nI appreciate it and thank you so much for watching.\\n\\nGoodbye or goodbye.\\n\\nWe'll bring you new episodes next week at 3:30 p.m. Eastern.\\n\\nNow let's get to some calls of the day here.\\n\\nJP Morgan upgrading Ferrari from neutral to overweight.\\n\\nThat's after investor meetings with top management in Asia and Australia.\\n\\nSo talking here to their clients about what they say, idiosyncratic profit drivers says found those investor means that management, it will prove impervious to a slowdown in China.\\n\\nThat would be a big deal.\\n\\nOf course, since we know that's impacting other high end automakers, European luxury brands emphasizes its unit volume growth discipline, innovation, record pricing and back luxury on that unit volume growth discipline.\\n\\nThey in their, in their note today, quote the company founder Enzo Ferrari, they say he's famous for having said Ferrari will always deliver one car less than the market demands.\\n\\nAnd so in this note, they praise Ferrari's um management of sort of making these sort of jewel boxes of cars and not making them readily available so that you have that scarcity value that's built into the company.\\n\\nYeah, JP Morgan says their bottom line, we have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on its long term plan.\\n\\nGiven what they say is plentiful evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply and micro strategy is aiming for a trillion dollar valuation as a Bitcoin Bank.\\n\\nThat's according to a new note out by Bernstein here, the Bernstein analyst hosted sailor to try and figure out the special sauce here and they basically dig into the strategy of micro strategy here to add as much Bitcoin as possible to the balance sheet here.\\n\\nAnd then um just keep doing it as sort of this Bitcoin Bank as they discussed it.\\n\\nNow, as we've talked about with seller himself, what do you then do with the Bitcoin?\\n\\nDo you end up lending it out as a bank?\\n\\nUh You know, we'll end up seeing what, what the end game is sailor as he is when he's on Yahoo Finance always bowled up saying everybody is against Bitcoin before they're for Bitcoin says this is the great of all technology transformations in the 21st century Julie.\\n\\nCome up shares of Trump Media and Technology Group or DJ T jumping again.\\n\\nToday we're gonna check in on the stock as well as a few other trending tickers on the other side.\\n\\nNow, for some of today's trending tickers, you can scan the QR code below to check out the best and worst performing stocks.\\n\\nThe session on Yahoo Finance, it is trending taker page first up a look at BP, the company warning of weak refining margins and broadly flat upstream production in the third quarter.\\n\\nThe basically the bottom line here, debt was likely to have risen in the third quarter because of those lower refining margins and debt has been trending in the opposite direction.\\n\\nSo the fact that it is rising here is something that investors do not seem terribly happy about.\\n\\nUm the sort of underlying oil story is that Brent crude prices fell 17% in the third quarter.\\n\\nSo this is something that and a lot of the other oil companies are going to be facing when they talk about these results.\\n\\nYeah, to your point, you noted in the statement that a barrel of Brent North Sea crude averaged about 8034 in Q three and that was down about five bucks from the previous quarter.\\n\\nAnd then of course, we talked about oil, I mean demand impacted by China weakness saw the spike in October on, on geopolitical tensions then bit of a breather again just looking at Brent back to 7897 right here.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nAnd by the way, this is not the full results from the company.\\n\\nWe get those on October 29th, uh exxonmobil, by the way, reporting on November 1st.\\n\\nAll right, moving on shares of Trump media extending its rally as it closes out an upbeat week for the stock.\\n\\nSo uh Trump Media Technology Group of course, owns uh the social media platform through social.\\n\\nWe know this one has been vital Julie, remember the high was about 79 in the debut earlier this year, Noah dived below 12 in September when Insiders could um could sell for the first time.\\n\\nNow, though rallying more than doubled share prices since late September looks as we know this is effectively seen as a proxy for the former president, chances president's chances at re election.\\n\\nAnd so the thing bounces all over the place at any given time this week.\\n\\nParticular though to your point has been active both on the volume front.\\n\\nWe've seen definitely a a substantial pick up in volume options have also seen a substantial pick up and the shares up something like 50% this week are actually poised for their best week going back to when they had the d back when this company went public through a special purpose acquisition company.\\n\\nUm You know, I always like to look at the short interest.\\n\\nI'm surprised, I'm surprised anybody who still, you know, lending out their shares in the because it's so all over the place, 13% of the float is shorted, which is high.\\n\\nSo, you know, as we have talked about before, people aren't buying this thing for any kind of fundamental value of truth, social.\\n\\nThey're buying it because they think if President Trump wins, then that'll be good news for us all.\\n\\nWe've got you covered with all the action following the closing bell.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"The market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan JPM and Wells Fargo WFC, even though Wells Fargo came up short on the top-line while JPMorgan beat both top- and bottom-line expectations.\\n\\nEven more important than the two banks' Q3 EPS and revenue surprises is their favorable commentary on business trends and the economy's overall health. Questions about the economy's outlook have been front and center for the market lately, with some in the market fearing that the Fed may have delayed the onset of its easing cycle.\\n\\nThe JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reports and management commentaries are reassuring on this count as they see a stable and positive spending environment, notwithstanding some stress at the lower end of the income distribution.\\n\\nWhile taking nothing away from the banks' positive results, part of the contributing factor to the market's favorable reaction is the reassuring read-through about the macro backdrop. This is a net positive for JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares, which had lost ground lately. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares relative to the market.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nJPMorgan's Q3 earnings were -1.9% below the year-earlier level on +7% higher revenues. The bank beat EPS and revenue estimates on better-than-expected net interest earnings and also provided positive guidance on this front for the current period. The company had warned recently of elevated net interest earnings expectations for next year, which had weighed on the stock since then. They reiterated that view after the Q3 earnings release, but the market appears to be discounting that outlook following the positive Q3 results.\\n\\nIn the core banking business, profitability remains constrained by margin pressures, cyclically soft demand for credit, and some deterioration in credit quality, albeit from a shallow level. On the capital markets side, trading revenues remain strong, and the investment banking business has started showing signs of growth but remains below the strong level two years ago.\\n\\nThere has been talk of 'green shoots' concerning deal pipelines, which many hope will translate into actual activities in the post-election phase now that the Fed has initiated the easing cycle. JPMorgan's investment banking fees increased more than +29% in Q3, with strong activities on the debt capital markets side.\\n\\nThe positive results from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo provide a positive read-through for the coming reports from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and others.\\n\\nRegarding the Q3 earnings season scorecard for the Finance sector, we now have results from 15.6% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance companies are down -0.1% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nLooking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +4.7% on +5% higher revenues.\\n\\nThe chart below shows the sector's Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what we saw from the sector in the last two periods and what is expected in the following three quarters.\\n\\nIncluding the aforementioned JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reports, we now have Q3 results for 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 29 index members that have already reported results are up +7.1% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 65.5% beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nThe Q3 reporting cycle ramps up this week, with over 100 companies on deck to report results, including 40 S&P 500 members. Banks, brokers, and other Finance sector players dominate this week's reporting docket, but we do have a fair amount of representation from other sectors, including Proctor & Gamble, Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, Schlumberger, CSX Corp., United Airlines, and others.\\n\\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for the 29 index members that have reported results in a historical context.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nIt is premature to identify any trends at this very early stage. Still, the favorable comparison of the revenue beats percentage will be significant if it endures through the rest of the Q3 reporting cycle.\\n\\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining results from the companies that have reported already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.6% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. This would follow the +10.2% earnings growth for the index in the preceding period on +5.5% higher revenues.\\n\\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what we saw in actual results over the preceding four quarters and what is expected over the following three quarters.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nNotwithstanding the modest growth pace in Q3, the aggregate earnings total for the period is expected to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.7% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nPlease note that this year's +7.7% earnings growth improves to +9.6% on an ex-Energy basis.\\n\\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> A Detailed Analysis of Q3 Earnings Expectations\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

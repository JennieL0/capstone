This preliminary pricing supplement is not an offer to sell nor does it seek an offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.\\n\\nPricing Supplement to the Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, each dated April 13, 2023, the Underlying Supplement No. 1-I dated April 13, 2023 and the Product Supplement No. 4-I dated April 13, 2023\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC\\n\\nMedium-Term Notes, Series A\\n\\n$\\n\\nBuffered Enhanced Participation Basket-Linked Notes due 2025\\n\\nFully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\n\\nThe notes will not bear interest. The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the stated maturity date (October 22, 2025, subject to adjustment) is based on the performance of an unequally weighted basket (which we refer to as the basket) consisting of the EURO STOXX 50 Index (36.00% initial weight), the TOPIX Index (26.00% initial weight), the FTSE 100 Index (17.00% initial weight), the Swiss Market Index (12.00% initial weight) and the S&P/ASX 200 Index (9.00% initial weight) as measured from and including the trade date (on or about October 18, 2023) to and including the determination date (October 20, 2025, subject to adjustment). The initial basket level is 100 and the final basket level will equal the sum of the products, as calculated for each basket underlier, of: (i) the closing level on the determination date divided by the initial basket underlier level (set on the trade date) multiplied by (ii) the applicable initial weighted value for such basket underlier. If the final basket level on the determination date is greater than the initial basket level (set on the trade date), the return on your notes will be positive. If the basket declines by up to 10.00% from the initial basket level to the final basket level, you will receive the principal amount of your notes. If the basket declines by more than 10.00% from the initial basket level to the final basket level, the return on your notes will be negative. You could lose your entire investment in the notes. Any payment on the notes is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (\\\"JPMorgan Financial\\\"), as issuer of the notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the notes.\\n\\nTo determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the basket return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final basket level from the initial basket level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 principal amount note, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:\\n\\nA decrease in the level of one or more basket underliers may offset increases in the levels of the other basket underliers. Due to the unequal weightings of the basket underliers, the performances of the EURO STOXX 50 Index, the TOPIX Index and the FTSE 100 Index will have a significantly larger impact on your return on the notes than the performance of the Swiss Market Index or the S&P/ASX 200 Index.\\n\\nYour investment in the notes involves certain risks, including, among other things, our credit risk. See \\\"Risk Factors\\\" on page S-2 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, \\\"Risk Factors\\\" on page PS-11 of the accompanying product supplement and \\\"Selected Risk Factors\\\" on page PS-15 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nThe foregoing is only a brief summary of the terms of your notes. You should read the additional disclosure provided herein so that you may better understand the terms and risks of your investment.\\n\\nIf the notes priced today and assuming an upside participation rate equal to the middle of the range listed above, the estimated value of the notes would be approximately $971.20 per $1,000 principal amount note. The estimated value of the notes, when the terms of the notes are set, will be provided in the final pricing supplement and will not be less than $961.20 per $1,000 principal amount note. See \\\"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\\\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement for additional information about the estimated value of the notes and \\\"Summary Information -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\\\" on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement for information about secondary market prices of the notes.\\n\\nSee \\\"Summary Information -- Supplemental Use of Proceeds\\\" on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement for information about the components of the original issue price of the notes.\\n\\n*J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which we refer to as JPMS, acting as agent for JPMorgan Financial, will pay all of the selling commissions it receives from us to an unaffiliated dealer. In no event will these selling commissions exceed 2.00% of the principal amount. See \\\"Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)\\\" on page PS-86 of the accompanying product supplement.\\n\\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\\"SEC\\\") nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying underlying supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\\n\\nThe notes are not bank deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency and are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\\n\\nPricing Supplement dated October , 2023\\n\\nThe original issue price, fees and commissions and net proceeds listed above relate to the notes we sell initially. We may decide to sell additional notes after the date of this pricing supplement, at issue prices and with fees and commission and net proceeds that differ from the amounts set forth above. The return (whether positive or negative) on your investment in notes will depend in part on the price you pay for your notes.\\n\\nWe may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the notes. In addition, JPMS or any other affiliate of ours may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in a note after its initial sale. Unless JPMS or its agents inform the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale, this pricing supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.\\n\\nIssuer: JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\n\\nThe accompanying product supplement refers to each basket underlier as an \\\"Underlying.\\\"\\n\\nPrincipal amount: each note will have a principal amount of $1,000; $ in the aggregate for all the offered notes; the aggregate principal amount of the offered notes may be increased if the issuer, at its sole option, decides to sell an additional amount of the offered notes on a date subsequent to the date of this pricing supplement\\n\\nPurchase at amount other than principal amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to the principal amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in the notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at the principal amount. Also, the stated buffer level would not offer the same benefit to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at the principal amount. See \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Notes Generally -- If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to the Principal Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at the Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected\\\" and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nPayment on the stated maturity date: for each $1,000 principal amount note, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:\\n\\nInitial basket level: Set equal to 100 on the trade date\\n\\nInitial weighted value: the initial weighted value for each of the basket underliers will equal the product of the initial weight of that basket underlier times the initial basket level. The initial weight of each basket underlier is shown in the table below:\\n\\nInitial basket underlier level (to be set on the trade date and will be the closing level of the applicable basket underlier on the trade date): with respect to each basket underlier, the closing level of the basket underlier on the trade date\\n\\nFinal basket level: the basket closing level on the determination date\\n\\nBasket closing level: the basket closing level on any relevant day will be the sum of the products of (i) the closing level of each basket underlier on that day divided by the initial basket underlier level of that basket underlier and (ii) the initial weighted value of that basket underlier\\n\\nBasket return: the quotient of (i) the final basket level minus the initial basket level divided by (ii) the initial basket level, expressed as a percentage.\\n\\nUpside participation rate (to be provided in the final pricing supplement): expected to be between 1.56 and 1.83\\n\\nDetermination date: October 20, 2025, subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event and as described under \\\"General Terms of Notes -- Postponement of a Determination Date -- Notes Linked to Multiple Underlyings\\\" on page PS-46 of the accompanying product supplement\\n\\nStated maturity date: October 22, 2025, subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event and as described under \\\"General Terms of Notes -- Postponement of a Payment Date\\\" on page PS-45 of the accompanying product supplement.

The following discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes.\\n\\nBased on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as \\\"open transactions\\\" that are not debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described in \\\"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences -- Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders -- Notes Treated as Open Transactions That Are Not Debt Instruments\\\" in the accompanying product supplement. Assuming this treatment is respected, the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \\\"prepaid forward contracts\\\" and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the \\\"constructive ownership\\\" regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.\\n\\nERISA: as described under \\\"Benefit Plan Investor Considerations\\\" on page PS-88 of the accompanying product supplement\\n\\nSupplemental plan of distribution: as described under \\\"Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)\\\" on page PS-86 of the accompanying product supplement; we estimate that our share of the total offering expenses, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . We expect to agree to sell to JPMS, and JPMS expects to agree to purchase from us, the aggregate principal amount of the notes specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement. JPMS proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the original issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement, and to an unaffiliated dealer at that price and to pay that dealer a selling commission not in excess of 2.00% of the principal amount.\\n\\nConflicts of interest: JPMS has a \\\"conflict of interest\\\" within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5121 in any offering of the notes in which it participates because JPMorgan Chase & Co. owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding equity securities of JPMS, because JPMS and we are under common control by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and because the net proceeds received from the sale of the notes will be used, in part, by JPMS or its affiliates in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes. The offering of the notes will comply with the requirements of Rule 5121 of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\\\"FINRA\\\") regarding a FINRA member firm's underwriting of securities of an affiliate. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121, neither JPMS nor any other affiliated agent of ours may make sales in the offering of the notes to any of its discretionary accounts without the specific written approval of the customer.\\n\\nFDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\\n\\nSupplemental Terms of the Notes\\n\\nFor purposes of the notes offered by this pricing supplement:\\n\\n(a) any reference to \\\"calculating the closing level of that Index last in effect prior to the commencement of the market disruption event (or prior to the non-trading day)\\\" under \\\"General Terms of Notes -- Postponement of a Determination Date -- Notes Linked to Multiple Underlyings\\\" in the accompanying product supplement will be deemed to refer to \\\"calculating the closing level of that Index last in effect prior to the commencement of the initial Disrupted Day\\\"; and\\n\\n(b) all references to each of the following terms used in the accompanying product supplement will be deemed to refer to the corresponding term used in this pricing supplement, as set forth in the table below:\\n\\nIn addition, the following terms used in this pricing supplement are not defined in the accompanying product supplement: basket return, initial basket level, initial basket underlier level, final basket level, initial weight, upside participation rate, buffer level, buffer amount and buffer rate. Accordingly, please refer to \\\"Key Terms\\\" on page PS-3 of this pricing supplement for the definitions of these terms.\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying product supplement, the provisions set forth under \\\"General Terms of Notes -- Consequences of a Change-in-Law Event\\\" in the accompanying product supplement do not apply to the notes.\\n\\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes\\n\\nThe estimated value of the notes when the terms of the notes are set, which we refer to as the estimated value of the notes, set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. For additional information, see \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate\\\" on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement. The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time. See \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Estimated Value of the Notes Does Not Represent Future Values of the Notes and May Differ from Others' Estimates\\\" on page PS-17 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nThe estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and the unaffiliated dealer, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits realized in hedging our obligations under the notes, if any, may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits. A fee will also be paid to SIMON Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering. See \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price of the Notes\\\" on page PS-17 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes\\n\\nFor information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes, see \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Be Impacted by Many Economic and Market Factors\\\" on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over the period from the trade date through January 18, 2024. The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates. See \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period\\\" on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nSupplemental Use of Proceeds\\n\\nThe notes are offered to meet investor demand for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See \\\"Hypothetical Examples\\\" on page PS-10 of this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the notes and \\\"The Basket and the Basket Underliers\\\" on page PS-20 of this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.\\n\\nThe original issue price of the notes is equal to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and the unaffiliated dealer, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.\\n\\nHYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES\\n\\nThe following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical basket closing levels or hypothetical closing levels of the basket underliers, as applicable, on the determination date could have on the payment at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.\\n\\nThe examples below are based on a range of final basket levels and closing levels of the basket underliers that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the basket closing level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final basket level will be on the determination date. The basket underliers have been highly volatile in the past -- meaning that the levels of the basket underliers have changed considerably in relatively short periods -- and their performances cannot be predicted for any future period.\\n\\nThe information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the offered notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the principal amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the basket underliers and our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness. In addition, the estimated value of the notes will be less than the original issue price. For more information on the estimated value of the notes, see \\\"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\\\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key terms and assumptions in the box below.\\n\\nMoreover, we have not yet set the initial basket underlier levels that will serve as the baselines for determining the basket return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial basket underlier level of each basket underlier may differ substantially from that basket underlier level prior to the trade date.\\n\\nFor these reasons, the actual performance of the basket over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical level of each basket underlier shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical levels of each basket underlier during recent periods, see \\\"The Basket and the Basket Underliers -- Historical Closing Levels of the Basket Underliers\\\" below. Before investing in the offered notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the basket underliers between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the offered notes.\\n\\nAlso, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the basket underliers.\\n\\nThe levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final basket levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial basket level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical payments at maturity, based on the corresponding hypothetical final basket level (expressed as a percentage of the initial basket level), and are expressed as percentages of the principal amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical payment at maturity of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the offered notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the principal amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final basket level (expressed as a percentage of the initial basket level) and the assumptions noted above.\\n\\nIf, for example, the final basket level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial basket level, the payment that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be approximately 27.778% of the principal amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the principal amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose approximately 72.222% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to principal amount you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment).\\n\\nThe following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical payments at maturity (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final basket level (expressed as a percentage of the initial basket level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final basket level (expressed as a percentage of the initial basket level) of less than 90.000% (the section left of the 90.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical payment at maturity of less than 100.000% of the principal amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes.\\n\\nThe following examples illustrate the hypothetical payment at maturity on each $1,000 principal amount note based on hypothetical initial basket underlier levels, each of which we refer to as an \\\"initial level,\\\" and closing levels of the basket underliers on the determination date, each of which we refer to as a \\\"final level,\\\" calculated based on the key terms and assumptions above. The hypothetical initial level for each basket underlier of 100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely initial level for that basket underlier. For historical data regarding the actual historical levels of the basket underliers, please see the historical information set forth below under \\\"The Basket and the Basket Underliers.\\\" The levels in Column A represent the hypothetical initial level for each basket underlier, and the levels in Column B represent hypothetical final levels for each basket underlier. The percentages in Column C represent hypothetical final levels for each basket underlier in Column B expressed as percentages of the corresponding hypothetical initial levels in Column A. The amounts in Column D represent the initial weighted values of each basket underlier, and the amounts in Column E represent the products of the percentages in Column C times the corresponding amounts in Column D. The final basket level for each example is shown beneath each example, and will equal the sum of the five products shown in Column E. The basket return for each example is shown beneath the final basket level for such example, and will equal the quotient of (i) the final basket level for such example minus the initial basket level divided by (ii) the initial basket level, expressed as a percentage. The values below have been rounded for ease of analysis.\\n\\nExample 1: The final basket level is greater than the initial basket level. The payment at maturity exceeds the $1,000 principal amount.\\n\\nIn this example, all of the hypothetical final levels for the basket underliers are greater than the applicable hypothetical initial levels, which results in the hypothetical final basket level being greater than the initial basket level of 100.00. Because the hypothetical final basket level of 105.00 exceeds the initial basket level, the hypothetical payment at maturity will equal:\\n\\nPayment at maturity = $1,000 + ($1,000 \\u00d7 1.56 \\u00d7 5.00%) = $1,078.00\\n\\nExample 2: The final basket level is less than the initial basket level but greater than the buffer level. The payment at maturity will equal the $1,000 principal amount.\\n\\nIn this example, all of the hypothetical final levels for the basket underliers are less than the applicable hypothetical initial levels, which results in the hypothetical final basket level being less than the initial basket level of 100.00. However, because the hypothetical final basket level of 95.00 is not less than the buffer level, the hypothetical payment at maturity will equal the $1,000 principal amount.\\n\\nExample 3: The final basket level is less than the buffer level. The payment at maturity is less than the $1,000 principal amount.\\n\\nIn this example, the hypothetical final level of the EURO STOXX 50Index is less than its hypothetical initial level, while the hypothetical final levels of the TOPIXIndex and the FTSE 100 Index are equal to their applicable hypothetical initial levels and the hypothetical final levels of the Swiss Market Index and S&P/ASX 200 Index are greater than their applicable initial levels.\\n\\nBecause the basket is unequally weighted, increases in the lower weighted basket underliers will be offset by decreases in the more heavily weighted basket underliers. In this example, the large decline in the EURO STOXX 50Index results in the hypothetical final basket level being less than the buffer level of 90.00% of the initial basket level, even though the TOPIXIndex and the FTSE 100 Index remained flat and the Swiss Market Index and the S&P/ASX 200 Index increased.\\n\\nBecause the hypothetical final basket level of 79.00 is less than the buffer level of 90.00% of the initial basket level, the hypothetical payment at maturity will equal:\\n\\nPayment at maturity = $1,000 + [$1,000 \\u00d7 1.1111 \\u00d7 (-21.00% + 10.00%)] = $877.78\\n\\nExample 4: The final basket level is less than the buffer level. The payment at maturity is less than the $1,000 principal amount.\\n\\nIn this example, although the hypothetical final level for one of the basket underliers is greater than its applicable hypothetical initial level, the hypothetical final levels of the other basket underliers decrease significantly from their hypothetical initial levels, which results in the hypothetical final basket level being less than the buffer level. Because the hypothetical final basket level of 70.00 is less than the buffer level, the hypothetical payment at maturity will equal:\\n\\nPayment at maturity = $1,000 + [$1,000 \\u00d7 1.1111 \\u00d7 (-30.00% + 10.00%)] = $777.78\\n\\nThe payments at maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the basket underliers that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical payments at maturity shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the offered notes. The hypothetical payments at maturity on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their principal amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the principal amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read \\\"Selected Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Be Impacted by Many Economic and Market Factors\\\" on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nThe hypothetical returns on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term. These hypotheticals do not reflect fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns shown above would likely be lower.\\n\\nWe cannot predict the actual final basket level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular day, nor can we predict the relationship between the level of each basket underlier and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the offered notes will depend on the actual initial basket underlier level of each basket underlier and upside participation rate we will provide in the final pricing supplement and the actual final basket level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.\\n\\nSelected Risk Factors\\n\\nAn investment in your notes is subject to the risks described below, as well as the risks described under the \\\"Risk Factors\\\" sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and the accompanying product supplement. Your notes are a riskier investment than ordinary debt securities. Also, your notes are not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier stocks, i.e., the stocks underlying the basket underliers that compose the basket to which your notes are linked. You should carefully consider whether the offered notes are suited to your particular circumstances.\\n\\nRisks Relating to the Notes Generally\\n\\nYou May Lose Some or All of Your Investment in the Notes\\n\\nThe notes do not guarantee any return of principal. The return on the notes at maturity is linked to the performance of the basket and will depend on whether, and the extent to which, the basket return is positive or negative. Your investment will be exposed to loss on a leveraged basis if the final basket level is less than the initial basket level by more than 10%. For every 1% that the final basket level is less than the initial basket level by more than 10%, you will lose an amount equal to approximately 1.1111% of the principal amount of your notes. Accordingly, you could lose some or all of your initial investment at maturity. Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.\\n\\nThe Notes Are Subject to the Credit Risks of JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\n\\nThe notes are subject to our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s credit risks, and our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s credit ratings and credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the notes. Investors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit risk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on our payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment.\\n\\nAs a Finance Subsidiary, JPMorgan Financial Has No Independent Operations and Has Limited Assets\\n\\nAs a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes. If these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase & Co., and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\n\\nNo Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights\\n\\nAs a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable for your notes on the stated maturity date exceeds the principal amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-basket-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have.\\n\\nWe May Sell an Additional Aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at a Different Issue Price\\n\\nAt our sole option, we may decide to sell an additional aggregate principal amount of the notes subsequent to the date of this pricing supplement. The issue price of the notes in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the original issue price you paid as provided on the cover of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nIf You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to the Principal Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at the Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected\\n\\nThe amount you will be paid for your notes on the stated maturity date will not be adjusted based on the price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the principal amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in the notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at the principal amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to the principal amount and hold them to the stated maturity date the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at the principal amount or a discount to the principal amount. In addition, the impact of the buffer level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to the principal amount. For example, the buffer level, while still providing an increase in the return on the notes if the final basket level is greater than or equal to the buffer level, will allow a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at the principal amount or a discount to the principal amount.\\n\\nCorrelation (or Lack of Correlation) of the Basket Underliers\\n\\nThe notes are linked to an unequally weighted basket. Performances of the basket underliers may or may not be correlated with each other. At a time when the values of one or more of the basket underliers increases, the values of the other basket underliers may not increase as much or may even decline. Therefore, in calculating the final basket level, increases in the value of one or more of the basket underliers may be moderated, or more than offset, by the lesser increases or declines in the values of other basket underliers. Further, because the basket underliers are unequally weighted, increases in the values of the lower-weighted basket underliers may be offset by even smaller decreases in values of the more heavily weighted basket underliers. In addition, high correlation of movements in the basket underliers during periods of negative returns among the basket underliers could have an adverse effect on the payment at maturity on the notes. There can be no assurance that the final basket level will be higher than the initial basket level.\\n\\nLack of Liquidity\\n\\nThe notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. JPMS intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but is not required to do so. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes.\\n\\nThe Final Terms and Valuation of the Notes Will Be Provided in the Final Pricing Supplement\\n\\nThe final terms of the notes will be based on relevant market conditions when the terms of the notes are set and will be provided in the final pricing supplement. In particular, each of the estimated value of the notes and the upside participation rate will be provided in the final pricing supplement and each may be as low as the applicable minimum set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement or under \\\"Summary Information -- Key Terms,\\\" as applicable. Accordingly, you should consider your potential investment in the notes based on the minimums for the estimated value of the notes and the upside participation rate.\\n\\nThe Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain\\n\\nThere is no direct legal authority as to the proper U.S. federal income tax characterization of the notes, and we do not intend to request a ruling from the IRS. The IRS might not accept, and a court might not uphold, the treatment of the notes described in \\\"Key Terms -- Tax treatment\\\" in this pricing supplement and in \\\"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\\\" in the accompanying product supplement. If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could differ materially and adversely from our description herein. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \\\"prepaid forward contracts\\\" and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying\\n\\nproperty to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the \\\"constructive ownership\\\" regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the section entitled \\\"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\\\" in the accompanying product supplement and consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.\\n\\nWe and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, including acting as calculation agent and as an agent of the offering of the notes, hedging our obligations under the notes and making the assumptions used to determine the pricing of the notes and the estimated value of the notes. Also, the distributor from which you purchase the notes may conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s economic interests, the economic interests of any distributor performing such duties and the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. In addition, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s business activities, and the business activities of any distributor from which you purchase the notes, including hedging and trading activities, could cause our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s economic interests to be adverse to yours and could adversely affect any payment on the notes and the value of the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines. If the distributor from which you purchase notes is to conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that distributor may profit in connection with such hedging activities and such profit, if any, will be in addition to the compensation that the distributor receives for the sale of the notes to you. You should be aware that the potential to earn fees in connection with hedging activities may create a further incentive for the distributor to sell the notes to you in addition to the compensation they would receive for the sale of the notes. Please refer to \\\"Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest\\\" on page PS-18 of the accompanying product supplement for additional information about these risks.\\n\\nRisks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\\n\\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price of the Notes\\n\\nThe estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the notes will exceed the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. See \\\"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\\\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Does Not Represent Future Values of the Notes and May Differ from Others' Estimates\\n\\nThe estimated value of the notes is determined by reference to internal pricing models of our affiliates when the terms of the notes are set. This estimated value of the notes is based on market conditions and other relevant factors existing at that time and assumptions about market parameters, which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s creditworthiness,\\n\\ninterest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions. See \\\"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\\\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate\\n\\nThe internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates' view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See \\\"Summary Information -- The Estimated Value of the Notes\\\" on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nThe Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period\\n\\nWe generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances. See \\\"Summary Information -- Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\\\" on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).\\n\\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Likely Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price of the Notes\\n\\nAny secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other things, secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and, also, because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and estimated hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result, the price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be lower than the original issue price. Any sale by you prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you. See the immediately following risk consideration for information about additional factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes.\\n\\nThe notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity. See \\\" -- Risks Relating to the Notes Generally -- Lack of Liquidity\\\" on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.\\n\\nSecondary Market Prices of the Notes Will Be Impacted by Many Economic and Market Factors\\n\\nThe secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify each other, aside from the selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging costs and the levels of the basket underliers, including:\\n\\nAdditionally, independent pricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price for the notes, which may also be reflected on customer account statements. This price may be different (higher or lower) than the price of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market.\\n\\nRisks Relating to the Basket Underliers\\n\\nThe Notes Do Not Provide Direct Exposure to Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates\\n\\nThe value of your notes will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies upon which the basket underlier stocks are based, although any currency fluctuations could affect the performance of the basket underlier. Therefore, if the applicable currencies appreciate or depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of the notes, you will not receive any additional payment or incur any reduction in your payment at maturity.\\n\\nThe Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Securities Issued by Non-U.S. Companies\\n\\nThe underlier stocks that compose the basket underliers have been issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in foreign markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.\\n\\nThe basket is an unequally weighted basket composed of five indices with the initial weights within the basket set forth in the table below:\\n\\nThe EURO STOXX 50 Index consists of 50 component stocks of market sector leaders from within the Eurozone.

The FTSE 100 Index measures the composite price performance of stocks of the largest 100 companies (determined on the basis of market capitalization) traded on the London Stock Exchange. For additional information about the FTSE 100 Index, see the information set forth under \\\"Equity Index Descriptions -- The FTSE 100 Index\\\" on page US-8 of the accompanying underlying supplement.\\n\\nIn addition, information about the FTSE 100 Index may be obtained from other sources including, but not limited to, that basket underlier sponsor's website (including information regarding that basket underlier's (i) top five constituents and their weightings and (ii) sector weightings).

For additional information see the information about the S&P/ASX 200 Index, see the information set forth under \\\"Equity Index Descriptions -- The S&P/ASX 200 Index\\\" on page US-43 of the accompanying underlying supplement.\\n\\nIn addition, information about the S&P/ASX 200 Index may be obtained from other sources including, but not limited to, that basket underlier sponsor's website (including information regarding that basket underlier's (i) top ten constituents, (ii) sector weightings and (iii) country weightings). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding that basket underlier is accurate or complete.\\n\\nHistorical Basket Levels\\n\\nYou should not take the historical levels of the basket or the basket underliers as an indication of the future performance of the basket or the basket underliers, respectively. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the basket, basket underliers or the underlier stocks will result in a return of any of your initial investment on the stated maturity date. In light of the increased volatility currently being experienced by the securities markets, and recent market declines, it may be substantially more likely that you could lose all or a substantial portion of your investment in the notes.\\n\\nNeither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the basket or the basket underliers. The actual performance of the basket or the basket underliers over the term of the offered notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.\\n\\nThe following graph is based on the basket closing levels for the period from January 4, 2018 (the first day in 2018 on which the closing levels of all basket underliers were published) through October 10, 2023, assuming that the basket closing level was 100 on January 4, 2018. We derived the basket closing levels based on the method of calculating the basket closing level as described in this pricing supplement and on the closing levels of the relevant basket underliers on the relevant dates. We obtained the closing levels reflected in the graph below from the Bloomberg Professional service (\\\"Bloomberg\\\"), without independent verification. The basket closing level has been normalized such that its hypothetical level on\\n\\nJanuary 4, 2018 was 100.

      "    \"body\": \"As required by the UK Listing Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 4.1 and 6.3, Crown Place VCT PLC today makes public its information relating to the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of Directors on 11 October 2023.\\n\\nThis announcement has not been audited.\\n\\nThe Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 (which have been audited), will shortly be sent to shareholders. Copies of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements will be shown via the Albion Capital Group LLP website by clicking www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN/30Jun23.pdf.\\n\\nInvestment policy\\n\\nThe Company invests in a broad portfolio of smaller, unquoted growth businesses across a variety of sectors including higher risk technology companies. Investments take the form of equity or a mixture of equity and loans.\\n\\nWhilst allocation of funds is determined by the investment opportunities which are available, efforts are made to ensure that the portfolio is diversified both in terms of sector and stage of maturity of investee businesses. Funds held pending investment or for liquidity purposes will be held principally as cash on deposit.\\n\\nRisk diversification and maximum exposures\\n\\nRisk is spread by investing in a number of different businesses within Venture Capital Trust qualifying industry sectors using a mixture of securities, as permitted. The maximum amount which the Company will invest in a single portfolio company is 15% of the Company's assets at cost thus ensuring a spread of investment risk. The value of an individual investment may increase over time as a result of trading progress and it is possible that it may grow in value to a point where it represents a significantly higher proportion of total assets prior to a realisation opportunity being available.\\n\\nThe Company's maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the amount of its adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not have any intention of utilising long-term gearing.\\n\\n\\u2020These are considered Alternative Performance Measures, see notes 2 and 3 of the Strategic report below for further explanation.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n(i) Prior to 6 April 1999, Venture Capital Trusts were able to add 20% to dividends and figures for the period up until 6 April 1999 are included at the gross equivalent rate actually paid to shareholders.\\n\\nA more detailed breakdown of the dividends paid per year can be found at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN under the 'Dividend History' section.\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share payable on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nChairman's statement\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe year saw the Company's portfolio facing a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop due to high inflation, rising interest rates and political instability which has caused the valuation of quoted technology companies to fall sharply. In spite of this, I am pleased to report an increase in total shareholder value of 1.06 pence per share for the year ended 30 June 2023, representing a 3.1% uplift on the opening net asset value.\\n\\nAlthough the Company's portfolio faces uncertainties, the Board remains encouraged by the progress that is being made by many of the portfolio companies. The Board recognises the importance of evaluating the Company's returns over the longer-term, as a venture capital portfolio can, by its nature, experience periods of short term volatility.\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nAs at 30 June 2023, the net asset value (\\\"NAV\\\") was \\u00a394.0 million or 33.13 pence per share compared with \\u00a385.8 million or 33.70 pence per share at 30 June 2022. The continuing progress of a number of our portfolio companies is discussed later in this statement and in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nIn line with the dividend policy targeting payment of around 5.0% of NAV per annum, the Company paid ordinary dividends of 1.63 pence per share during the year to 30 June 2023, which equates to 4.8% of the opening NAV (30 June 2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share).\\n\\nThe Board is pleased to declare a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share, representing 2.5% of the prevailing NAV, to be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nInvestment performance and progress\\n\\nOur portfolio has performed well despite the global uncertainties faced, and this has contributed to the total uplift in value of \\u00a33.8 million to the Company's investments for the year (30 June 2022: \\u00a36.4 million). Quantexa, the largest company within our portfolio (18% of net asset value), was the main contributor to the net gain, increasing its value by \\u00a36.8 million following an externally led $129 million Series E fundraising which completed in April 2023. Other unrealised gains in the year, again driven by strong trading and revenue growth, included Convertr of \\u00a30.6 million and Solidatus of \\u00a30.5 million. These gains were partially offset by write downs in Black Swan which decreased by \\u00a31.5 million, uMotif by \\u00a30.9 million and Oviva by \\u00a30.8 million.\\n\\nThe Company realised disposal proceeds of \\u00a30.7 million (2022: \\u00a37.2 million). The largest disposals being a part disposal of our shareholding in our AIM quoted investment, Arecor Therapeutics PLC (\\u00a30.3 million) and an exit of Zift (\\u00a30.2 million). There were also several investments written off during the year, however their valuations had already been substantially reduced in previous years and had little impact on the return for the year. Further details on the realisations during the year can be found in the realisations table on page 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe three largest investments in the Company's portfolio, Quantexa, Proveca and Radnor House are valued at \\u00a324.8 million and represent 26.4% of the Company's net asset value. The company regularly monitors its concentration risk and as announced on 6 October 2023, the Company sold \\u00a31.2 million of its holding in Quantexa at its current valuation to reduce its concentration risk.\\n\\nThe Company has been an active investor during the year with \\u00a37.9 million invested in 11 new and 11 existing portfolio companies. The new portfolio companies are expected to require further investment as the companies prove themselves and grow. The following are the five largest new investments:\\n\\nA full list of the Company's investments and disposals, including their movements in value for the year, can be found in the Portfolio of investments section on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nBoard composition\\n\\nI have had the privilege of serving as a Director of the Company for nine years, including three as Chairman, and I will retire at the Annual General Meeting in November 2023. I am delighted that James Agnew, an existing Board member, will succeed me as Chairman.\\n\\nFollowing a formal selection process and as part of its ongoing succession planning, the Board is pleased to welcome Tony Ellingham who joined the Board on 1 September 2023.\\n\\nWhen James Agnew becomes Chairman of the Board, Tony Ellingham will become the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee; Pam Garside will become the Senior Independent Director; and Ian Spence will become Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.\\n\\nRisks and uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company faces a number of significant risks, including higher interest rates, high levels of inflation, the ongoing impact of geopolitical tensions, and an expected period of economic stagnation in the UK and other markets. This complex backdrop is factored into how the Company is managed, including in its management of cash.\\n\\nOur investment portfolio, while concentrated mainly in the technology and healthcare sectors, remains diversified in terms of both sub-sector and stage of maturity and, importantly, we believe it to be appropriately valued.\\n\\nThe Manager is continually assessing the exposure to these risks for each portfolio company and appropriate actions, where possible, are being implemented. This includes the potential provision of further financial support to portfolio companies where necessary.\\n\\nA detailed analysis of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business is shown in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nShare buy-backs and reserves\\n\\nIt remains the Board's primary objective to maintain sufficient resources for investment in existing and new portfolio companies and for the continued payment of dividends to shareholders. The Board's policy is to buy back shares in the market, subject to the overall constraint that such purchases are in the Company's interest. It is the Board's intention for such buy-backs to be in the region of a 5% discount to net asset value, so far as market conditions and liquidity permit.\\n\\nThe Company also manages a relatively high level of distributable reserves which can be used for share buy-backs and the payment of dividends. As in the past, the Company has sought authority from shareholders for the reclassification of the share premium account to create additional distributable reserves, which is being done again this year as explained on page 50 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nAlbion VCTs Prospectus Top Up Offers\\n\\nYour Board, in conjunction with the boards of the other five VCTs managed by Albion Capital Group LLP, launched a prospectus top up Offer of new Ordinary shares on 10 October 2022. On 10 March 2023 the Offer was fully subscribed and closed to further applications raising \\u00a311.5 million including the overallotment facility. The Board was pleased to see the high level of demand for the Company's shares from existing and new shareholders.\\n\\nThe proceeds raised by the Company pursuant to the Offer are added to the liquid resources available for investment, positioning the Company to take advantage of new investment opportunities. Details on the share allotments during the year can be found in note 15.\\n\\nAnnual General Meeting\\n\\nThe AGM will be held virtually at noon on 22 November 2023 via the Lumi platform. Information on how to participate in the live webcast can be found on the Manager's website www.albion.capital/vct-hub/agms-events.\\n\\nThe Board welcomes questions from shareholders at the AGM and shareholders will be able to ask questions using the Lumi platform during the AGM. Alternatively, shareholders can email their questions to crownchair@albion.capital prior to the AGM.\\n\\nShareholders' views are important, and the Board encourages shareholders to vote on the resolutions.\\n\\nFurther details on the format and business to be conducted at the AGM can be found in the Directors' report on pages 49 and 50, and in the Notice of the Meeting on pages 91 and 92, of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nAudit tender process\\n\\nFollowing a formal and rigorous audit tender process, the intention is to appoint Johnston Carmichael LLP (\\\"Johnston Carmichael\\\") as the new Auditor of the Company in October 2023. Johnston Carmichael will conduct the audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024. Shareholders will be asked to confirm the appointment of Johnston Carmichael at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. BDO conducted the audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 and their report can be found on pages 64 to 70 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Board would like to express their gratitude to BDO for their diligent service over 16 years. Further details on the tender process can be found in the Statement of corporate governance on page 56 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nShareholder seminar\\n\\nThe next Shareholder Seminar will be held at the Royal College of Surgeons, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PE on 15 November 2023 and the Board will be delighted to see as many shareholders as possible at the event. The Board and Manager are keen to interact with shareholders and look forward to sharing with you further portfolio updates, as well as answering any questions. Places are limited and to reserve a place please email info@albion.capital with subject heading \\\"Shareholder Seminar\\\" and include your full name. You will receive an email confirmation of your place, subject to availability.\\n\\nMore details are available on the Albion Capital website: www.albion.capital.\\n\\nOutlook and prospects\\n\\nThe Board is encouraged by the positive results for the year just ended in what are uncertain times, principally outside the Company's control. The Board believes the portfolio is well diversified in terms of maturity and target sectors, many of which do not depend on consumer sentiment. Therefore, the Board continues to have confidence that the Company is well positioned in the current economic environment to generate long term value for shareholders.\\n\\nCrown Place VCT PLC (the \\\"Company\\\") is a Venture Capital Trust and its investment policy can be found above.\\n\\nBusiness model\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, the Company has no employees and has outsourced the management of all its operations to Albion Capital Group LLP, including secretarial and administrative services. Further details of the Investment Management Agreement can be found below.\\n\\nCurrent portfolio sector allocation\\n\\nThe pie charts at the end of this announcement are a useful way of showing the split of the portfolio valuation as at 30 June 2023 by: sector; stage of investment measured by revenues; and size measured by number of employees. Details of the principal investments made by the Company are shown in the Portfolio of investments on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nDirection of portfolio\\n\\nThe analysis of the Company's investment portfolio shows that it is well diversified and spread across the FinTech, healthcare (including digital healthcare), software and technology, renewable energy, and education sectors.\\n\\nCash and net current assets are a significant proportion of the portfolio at 28%. The main use of these funds will be to invest in higher growth technology companies, and therefore the shift away from asset based companies will continue. The funds will also be used to pay dividends, buyback shares and for the operating expenses of the Company. The Company has a significant speciality in healthcare, FinTech and software investing, which account for 58% of the net asset value of the Company.\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nThe Company paid dividends totalling 1.63 pence per share during the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: 3.21 pence per share which included a 1.50 pence per share special dividend). The dividend objective of the Board is to provide shareholders with a regular dividend flow. The Board declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This dividend will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nAs shown in the Company's Income statement below, the total return for the year was 1.05 pence per share (2022: 2.09 pence per share). The net asset value decreased to 33.13 pence per share (2022: 33.70 pence per share). This decrease in net asset value was primarily due to the payment of 1.63 pence per share of dividends during the year, partly offset by the total return in the year.\\n\\nInvestment income has increased to \\u00a3936,000 (2022: \\u00a3853,000). This is a result of bank interest and income from fixed term funds increasing to \\u00a3283,000 (2022: \\u00a317,000) as a result of rising interest rates. Loan stock income decreased to \\u00a3569,000 (2022: \\u00a3763,000) as the prior year included a large payment of previously capitalised interest.\\n\\nThe gain on investments for the year was \\u00a33,846,000 (2022: gain of \\u00a36,386,000). The key drivers of this gain are detailed in the Chairman's statement above. A full analysis of the Portfolio of investments can be seen on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe net cash flow for the Company has been a net outflow of \\u00a33,018,000 for the year (2022: inflow of \\u00a3598,000), reflecting new investments, dividends paid, ongoing expenses and the buy-back of shares, offset by disposal proceeds, loan stock income, and the issue of new Ordinary shares under the Top Up Offer.\\n\\nReview of the business and future changes\\n\\nA detailed review of the Company's business during the year is contained in the Chairman's statement above.\\n\\nThere is a continuing focus on growing the healthcare (including digital healthcare), FinTech and software and other technology sectors. The majority of these investment returns are delivered through equity and capital gains and are expected to be the key driver of success for the Company. Investment income, which is received primarily from our renewable energy investments, is expected to remain steady over the coming years.\\n\\nDetails of significant events which have occurred since the end of the financial year are listed in note 19. Details of transactions with the Manager are shown in note 5.\\n\\nFuture prospects\\n\\nThe Company's financial results for the year ended 30 June 2023 demonstrate that the portfolio remains well balanced across sectors and risk classes, and is largely weathering the ongoing global issues caused as a result of high levels of interest rates and inflation, and other economic headwinds. Although there remains much uncertainty, the Board considers that the current portfolio and the pipeline of opportunities should enable the Company to maintain a predictable stream of dividend payments to shareholders, as well as delivering long term growth for shareholders. Further details on the Company's outlook and prospects can be found in the Chairman's statement above.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators (\\\"KPIs\\\") and Alternative Performance Measures (\\\"APMs\\\")\\n\\nThe Directors believe that the following KPIs (some of which are APMs), which are typical for Venture Capital Trusts, used in its own assessment of the Company, will provide shareholders with sufficient information to assess how effectively the Company is applying its investment policy to meet its objectives. The Directors are satisfied that the results shown in the following KPIs and APMs give a good indication that the Company is achieving its investment objective and policy. These are:\\n\\nThe graph on page 8 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements shows the Company's total shareholder value relative to the FTSE All-Share Index total return, with dividends reinvested. The FTSE All-Share Index is considered a reasonable benchmark as the Company is classed as a generalist UK VCT investor, and this index includes over 600 companies listed in the UK, including small-cap, covering a range of sectors. Details on the performance of the net asset value and return per share for the year are shown in the Chairman's statement.\\n\\nTotal shareholder value increased by 1.06 pence per share to 101.31 pence per share (2022: 100.25) for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\n2. Movement in shareholder value in the year \\u2020\\n\\n\\u2020 Methodology: Calculated as the movement in total shareholder value for the year divided by the opening net asset value.\\n\\n3. Dividend distributions\\n\\nDividends paid in respect of the year ended 30 June 2023 were 1.63 pence per share (2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share). Cumulative dividends paid since launch (on 18 January 1998) amount to 68.18 pence per share.\\n\\n4. Ongoing charges\\n\\nThe ongoing charges ratio for the year ended 30 June 2023 was 2.20% (2022: 2.18%). The ongoing charges ratio has been calculated using The Association of Investment Companies' (\\\"AIC\\\") recommended methodology. This figure shows shareholders the total recurring annual running expenses (including investment management fees charged to capital reserve, but excluding any performance incentive fees) as a percentage of the average net assets attributable to shareholders. The Directors expect the ongoing charges ratio for the year ahead to remain stable at approximately 2.20%.\\n\\n5. VCT compliance*\\n\\nThe investment policy is designed to ensure that the Company continues to qualify and is approved as a VCT by HMRC. In order to maintain its status under Venture Capital Trust legislation, a VCT must comply on a continuing basis with the provisions of Section 274 of the Income Tax Act 2007, details of which are provided in the Directors' report on page 46 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe relevant tests to measure compliance have been carried out and independently reviewed for the year ended 30 June 2023. These showed that the Company has complied with all tests and continues to do so.\\n\\n*VCT compliance is not a numerical measure of performance and thus cannot be defined as an APM.\\n\\nGearing\\n\\nAs defined by the Articles of Association, the Company's maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not currently have any intention to utilise gearing for the Company.\\n\\nOperational arrangements\\n\\nThe Company has delegated the investment management of the portfolio to the Manager, Albion Capital Group LLP, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The Manager also provides company secretarial and other accounting and administrative support to the Company.\\n\\nInvestment Management Agreement\\n\\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement (\\\"IMA\\\"), the Manager provides investment management, secretarial and administrative services to the Company. The IMA can be terminated by either party on 12 months' notice and is subject to earlier termination in the event of certain breaches or on the insolvency of either party. The Manager is paid an annual fee equal to 1.75% of the net asset value of the Company, and an annual secretarial and administrative fee of \\u00a350,000 per annum. Total annual expenses, including the management fee, are limited to 3% of the net asset value.\\n\\nIn some instances, the Manager is entitled to an arrangement fee, payable by a portfolio company in which the Company invests, in the region of 2.0% of the investment made, and also monitoring fees where the Manager has a representative on the portfolio company's board.\\n\\nManagement performance incentive fee\\n\\nIn order to align the interests of the Manager and shareholders with regards to generating positive returns, the Manager is entitled to charge an incentive fee in the event that the returns exceed minimum target levels. Under the incentive arrangements, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Manager of an amount equal to 20% of such excess return that is calculated for each financial year.\\n\\nThe performance hurdle requires that the growth of the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period (both revenue and capital), compared with the previous accounting date, exceeds the average base rate of the Royal Bank of Scotland plc plus 2.0%. If the target return is not achieved in a period, the cumulative shortfall is carried forward to the next accounting period and has to be made up before an incentive fee becomes payable.\\n\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023, the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period amounted to 34.76 pence per share, compared to a hurdle of 35.69 pence per share. As a result, no performance incentive fee is payable to the Manager (2022: \\u00a3584,000).\\n\\nInvestment and co-investment\\n\\nThe Company co-invests with other Venture Capital Trusts and funds managed by the Manager. Allocation of investments is on the basis of an allocation agreement which is based, inter alia, on the ratio of funds available for investment.\\n\\nEvaluation of the Manager\\n\\nThe Board has evaluated the performance of the Manager based on:\\n\\n* the returns generated by the Company;\\n\\n* the continuing achievement of the HMRC tests for VCT status;\\n\\n* the long term prospects of the current portfolio of investments;\\n\\n* the management of treasury, including use of buy-backs and participation in fund raising; and\\n\\n* benchmarking the performance of the Manager to other service providers including the performance of other VCTs that the Manager is responsible for managing.\\n\\nThe Board believes that it is in the interests of shareholders as a whole, and of the Company, to continue the appointment of the Manager for the forthcoming year.\\n\\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\\\"AIFMD\\\")\\n\\nThe Board appointed the Manager as the Company's AIFM in 2014 as required by the AIFMD. The Manager is a full-scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the AIFMD. Ocorian Depositary (UK) Limited is the appointed Depositary and oversees the custody and cash arrangements and provides other AIFMD duties with respect to the Company.\\n\\nConsumer duty\\n\\nThe Consumer Duty came into effect from 31 July 2023. These new rules set a higher standard of consumer protection in financial services. The Manager as AIFM is within scope of the FCA's Consumer Duty, but the Company itself is not.\\n\\nThe Manager is a manufacturer of the Company's shares as it is a firm that has some influence over design and distribution of the Company's share product. The Manager's first assessment of value for the Company's shares was completed in April 2023. The value assessment concluded that the Company provides fair value for shareholders.\\n\\nWhere the Manager concludes that changes will help deliver good outcomes for consumers, it will recommend these changes to the Board.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006 Section 172 Reporting\\n\\nUnder Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Board has a duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole in both the long and short term, having regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Company, such as suppliers, and to do so with an understanding of the impact on the community and environment and with high standards of business conduct, which includes acting fairly between members of the Company.\\n\\nThe Board is very conscious of these wider responsibilities in the ways it promotes the Company's culture and ensures, as part of its regular oversight, that the integrity of the Company's affairs is foremost in the way the activities are managed and promoted. This includes regular engagement with the wider stakeholders of the Company and being alert to issues that might damage the Company's standing in the way that it operates. The Board works very closely with the Manager in reviewing how stakeholder issues are handled, ensuring good governance and responsibility in managing the Company's affairs, as well as visibility and openness in how the affairs are conducted.\\n\\nThe Company is an externally managed investment company with no employees, and as such has nothing to report in relation to employee engagement but does keep close attention to how the Board operates as a cohesive and competent unit. The Company also has no customers in the traditional sense and, therefore, there is also nothing to report in relation to relationships with customers.\\n\\nThe table that follows sets out the key stakeholders, details how the Board has engaged with these key stakeholders, and the effect of these considerations on the Company's decisions and strategies during the year.\\n\\nSocial and community issues, employees and human rights\\n\\nThe Board recognises the requirement under section 414C of the Act to detail information about social and community issues, employees and human rights; including any policies it has in relation to these matters and effectiveness of these policies. As an externally managed investment company with no employees, the Company has no formal policies in these matters, however, it is at the core of its responsible investment strategy as detailed above.\\n\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\\\"GDPR\\\") has the objective of unifying data privacy requirements across the European Union. GDPR forms part of the UK law after Brexit, now known as UK GDPR. The Manager continues to take action to ensure that the Manager and the Company are compliant with the regulation.\\n\\nFurther policies\\n\\nThe Company has adopted a number of further policies relating to:\\n\\nand these are set out in the Directors' report on page 47 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nRisk management\\n\\nThe Board carries out a regular review of the risk environment in which the Company operates, together with changes to the environment and individual risks. The Board also identifies emerging risks which might impact on the Company. In the period the most noticeable risks have been rising interest rates and inflation, caused in part as a result of the geopolitical tensions, and pricing volatility in world markets, particularly affecting growth stocks. The full impact of these risks are likely to continue to be uncertain for some time.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the Company's principal risks and uncertainties and seeks to mitigate these risks through regular reviews of performance and monitoring progress and compliance. The Board applies the principles detailed in the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, in the mitigation and management of these risks. More information on specific mitigation measures for the principal risks and uncertainties are explained below:\\n\\nViability statement\\n\\nIn accordance with the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2018 and provision 36 of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over three years to 30 June 2026. The Directors believe that three years is a reasonable period in which they can assess the ability of the Company to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. This is the period used by the Board as part of its strategic planning process, which includes: the estimated timelines for finding, assessing and completing investments; the potential impact of any new regulations; and the availability of cash.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company, including those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, and focused on the major factors which affect the economic, regulatory and political environment. The Board carefully assessed, and were satisfied with, the risk management processes in place to avoid or reduce the impact of these risks. The Board has carried out robust stress testing of cashflows which included; factoring in higher levels of inflation when budgeting for future expenses, only including proceeds from investment disposals where there is a high probability of completion, whilst also assessing the requirement for any future financial support of portfolio companies.\\n\\nThe Board has additionally considered the ability of the Company to comply with the ongoing conditions to ensure it maintains its VCT qualifying status under its current investment policy. As a result of the Board's quarterly valuation reviews, it has concluded that the portfolio is well balanced and geared towards delivering long term growth and strong returns to shareholders.\\n\\nThe Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to 30 June 2026. The Board is mindful of the ongoing risks and will continue to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, in addition to monitoring the quarterly cashflow forecasts to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006\\n\\nThis Strategic report of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2023 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 (the \\\"Act\\\"). The purpose of this report is to provide Shareholders with sufficient information to enable them to assess the extent to which the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the Company in accordance with Section 172 of the Act.\\n\\nIn preparing these Financial Statements for the year to 30 June 2023, the Directors of the Company, being Penny Freer, James Agnew, Tony Ellingham, Pam Garside and Ian Spence, confirm to the best of their knowledge:\\n\\nWe consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\\n\\nA detailed \\\"Statement of Directors' responsibilities\\\" is contained on page 52 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe total column of this Income statement represents the profit and loss account of the Company. The supplementary revenue and capital columns are prepared under guidance published by The Association of Investment Companies.\\n\\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these Financial Statements.\\n\\nThese Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors, and authorised for issue on 11 October 2023 and were signed on its behalf by\\n\\n* Included within these reserves is an amount of \\u00a312,804,000 (2022: \\u00a324,165,000) which is considered distributable.\\n\\nThe nature of each reserve is described in note 2 below.\\n\\nStatement of cash flows\\n\\n* Purchases and disposals detailed above do not agree to note 11 due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\n** The cost of issue of equity does not agree to the Statement of changes in equity due to prospectus fundraising amounts being received net of fees.\\n\\n*** The equity dividends paid shown in the cash flow are different to the dividends disclosed in note 9 as a result of the non-cash effect of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme.\\n\\nNotes to the Financial Statements\\n\\n1. Basis of preparation\\n\\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 (\\\"FRS 102\\\"), and with the Statement of Recommended Practice \\\"Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts\\\" (\\\"SORP\\\") issued by The Association of Investment Companies (\\\"AIC\\\"). The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and further details can be found in the Directors' report on page 45 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The most critical estimates and judgements relate to the determination of carrying value of investments at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (\\\"FVTPL\\\") in accordance with FRS 102 sections 11 and 12. The Company values investments by following the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (\\\"IPEV\\\") Guidelines as updated in 2022 and further detail on the valuation techniques used are outlined below.\\n\\nCompany information is shown on page 4 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\n2. Accounting policies\\n\\nFixed asset investments\\n\\nThe Company's business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth. This portfolio of financial assets is managed, and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment policy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board.\\n\\nIn accordance with the requirements of FRS 102, those undertakings in which the Company holds more than 20% of the equity as part of an investment portfolio are not accounted for using the equity method. In these circumstances the investment is measured at FVTPL.\\n\\nUpon initial recognition (using trade date accounting) investments, including loan stock, are classified by the Company as FVTPL and are included at their initial fair value, which is cost (excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off to the Income statement).\\n\\nSubsequently, the investments are valued at 'fair value', which is measured as follows:\\n\\nInvestments are recognised as financial assets on legal completion of the investment contract and are de-recognised on legal completion of the sale of an investment.\\n\\nDividend income is not recognised as part of the fair value movement of an investment, but is recognised separately as investment income through the other distributable reserve when a share becomes ex-dividend.\\n\\nCurrent assets and payables\\n\\nReceivables (including debtors due after more than one year), payables and cash are carried at amortised cost, in accordance with FRS 102. Deferred consideration meets the definition of a financing transaction held at amortised cost, and interest will be recognised through capital over the credit period using the effective interest method. There are no financial liabilities other than payables.\\n\\nInvestment income\\n\\nDividend income\\n\\nDividend income is included in revenue when the investment is quoted ex-dividend.\\n\\nUnquoted loan stock income\\n\\nFixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised when the Company's right to receive payment and expect settlement is established. Where interest is rolled up and/or payable at redemption then it is recognised as income unless there is reasonable doubt as to its receipt.\\n\\nFixed term funds income\\n\\nFunds income is recognised on an accruals basis using the agreed rate of interest.\\n\\nBank deposit income\\n\\nInterest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the rate of interest agreed with the bank.\\n\\nInvestment management fee, performance incentive fee and other expenses\\n\\nAll expenses have been accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged through the other distributable reserve except the following which are charged through the realised capital reserve:\\n\\nTaxation\\n\\nTaxation is applied on a current basis in accordance with FRS 102. Current tax is tax payable (refundable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the current period or past reporting periods using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the financial reporting date. Taxation associated with capital expenses is applied in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences at the reporting date. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements. As a VCT the Company has an exemption from tax on capital gains. The Company intends to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval as a VCT in the foreseeable future. The Company therefore, should have no material deferred tax timing differences arising in respect of the revaluation or disposal of investments and the Company has not provided for any deferred tax.\\n\\nReserves\\n\\nCalled-up share capital\\n\\nThis accounts for the nominal value of the Company's shares.\\n\\nShare premium\\n\\nThis accounts for the difference between the price paid for shares and the nominal value of the shares, less issue costs and transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nCapital redemption reserve\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for amounts by which the issued share capital is diminished through the repurchase and cancellation of the Company's own shares, less any transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nUnrealised capital reserve\\n\\nIncreases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end against cost are included in this reserve.\\n\\nRealised capital reserve\\n\\nThe following are disclosed in this reserve:\\n\\nOther distributable reserve\\n\\nThe special reserve, treasury share reserve and the revenue reserve were combined in 2012 to form a single reserve named other distributable reserve.\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for movements from the revenue column of the Income statement, the payment of dividends, the buy-back of shares, transfers from the share premium and capital redemption reserve, and other non-capital realised movements.\\n\\nDividends\\n\\nDividends by the Company are accounted for when the liability to make the payment (record date) has been established.\\n\\nSegmental reporting\\n\\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single operating segment of business, being investment in smaller companies principally based in the UK.\\n\\nFurther details of the Investment Management Agreement under which the investment manager's fee is paid are given in the Strategic report above.\\n\\nDuring the year, services of a total value of \\u00a31,583,000 (2022: \\u00a31,425,000) were purchased by the Company from Albion Capital Group LLP (\\\"Albion\\\") comprising \\u00a31,533,000 of management fees (2022: \\u00a31,375,000) and \\u00a350,000 of administration fees (2022: \\u00a350,000). There is no performance incentive fee payable this year (2022: \\u00a3584,000). At the financial year end, the amount due to Albion in respect of these services disclosed as accruals and deferred income was \\u00a3422,500 (administration fee accrual: \\u00a312,500, management fee accrual \\u00a3410,000) (2022: \\u00a3971,500).\\n\\nAlbion is, from time to time, eligible to receive an arrangement fee and monitoring fees from portfolio companies. During the year ended 30 June 2023 fees of \\u00a3299,000 attributable to the investments of the Company were received pursuant to these arrangements (2022: \\u00a3121,000).\\n\\nAlbion, its partners and staff holds 2,385,697 Ordinary shares in the Company as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThe Company entered into an offer agreement relating to the Offers pursuant to which Albion received a fee of 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the Offers and out of which Albion paid the costs of the Offers, as detailed in the Prospectus.\\n\\n6. Other expenses\\n\\n7. Directors' fees\\n\\nThe amounts paid to and on behalf of the Directors during the year are as follows:\\n\\nThe Company's key management personnel are the Directors. Further information regarding Directors' remuneration can be found in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 61 and 62 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe tax charge for the year shown in the Income statement is lower than the average standard rate of corporation tax of 20.50% (2022: 19.0%). The differences are explained above. From 1 April 2023, the Company's rate of corporation tax increased from 19% to 25%.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n(i) Venture Capital Trusts are not subject to corporation tax on capital gains.\\n\\n(ii) Tax relief on expenses charged to capital has been determined by allocating tax relief to expenses by reference to the applicable corporation tax rate and allocating the relief between revenue and capital in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\n(iii) The Company has excess management expenses of \\u00a321,392,000 (2022: \\u00a320,279,000) that are available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of \\u00a35,348,000 (2022: \\u00a33,853,000) has not been recognised in respect of these losses as they will be recoverable only to the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable profits.\\n\\n9. Dividends\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023. The total dividend will be approximately \\u00a32,354,000. All dividends are paid from the other distributable reserve.\\n\\nDuring the year, unclaimed dividends older than twelve years of \\u00a313,000 (2022: \\u00a313,000) were returned to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Association and have been accounted for on an accruals basis.\\n\\n10. Basic and diluted return per share\\n\\nThe weighted average number of shares is calculated after adjusting for treasury shares of 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916).\\n\\nThere are no convertible instruments, derivatives or contingent share agreements in issue so basic and diluted return/(loss) per share are the same.\\n\\nPurchases and disposals detailed above may not agree to the Statement of cash flows due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as a result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both impaired and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nUnquoted fixed asset investments are valued at fair value in accordance with the IPEV guidelines as follows:\\n\\nWhen using the cost or price of a recent investment in the valuations, the Company looks to re-calibrate this price at each valuation point by reviewing progress within the investment, comparing against the initial investment thesis, assessing if there are any significant events or milestones that would indicate the value of the investment has changed and considering whether a market-based methodology (i.e. using multiples from comparable public companies) or a discounted cashflow forecast would be more appropriate. The background to the transaction is also considered when the price of investment may not be an appropriate measure of fair value, for example, disproportionate dilution of existing investors from a new investor coming on board or the market conditions at the time of investment no longer being a true reflection of fair value.\\n\\nThe main inputs into the calibration exercise, and for the valuation models using multiples, are revenue, EBITDA and P/E multiples (based on the most recent revenue, EBITDA or earnings achieved and equivalent corresponding revenue, EBITDA or earnings multiples of comparable companies), quality of earnings assessments and comparability difference adjustments. Revenue multiples are often used, rather than EBITDA or earnings, due to the nature of the Company's investments, being in growth and technology companies which are not normally expected to achieve profitability or scale for a number of years. Where an investment has achieved scale and profitability the Company would normally then expect to switch to using an EBITDA or earnings multiple methodology.\\n\\nIn the calibration exercise and in determining the valuation for the Company's equity instruments, comparable trading multiples are used. In accordance with the Company's policy, appropriate comparable companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation, growth rate and strategy are determined and a trading multiple for each comparable company identified is then calculated. The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its revenue, EBITDA or earnings. The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity, marketability and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.\\n\\nFair value investments had the following movements between valuation methodologies between 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2023:\\n\\nThe valuation will be the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. The Directors believe that, within these parameters, there are no other more relevant methods of valuation which would be reasonable as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nFRS 102 and the SORP requires the Company to disclose the inputs to the valuation methods applied to its investments measured at FVTPL in a fair value hierarchy. The table below sets out fair value hierarchy definitions using FRS 102 s.11.27.\\n\\nQuoted investments are valued according to Level 1 valuation methods. Unquoted equity, preference shares and loan stock are all valued according to Level 3 valuation methods.\\n\\nInvestments held at fair value through profit or loss (Level 3) had the following movements:\\n\\n*Additions and disposals do not agree to the cash flow due to loan stock conversions and non-cash consideration.\\n\\nFRS 102 requires the Directors to consider the impact of changing one or more of the inputs used as part of the valuation process to reasonable possible alternative assumptions. 70% of the portfolio of investments, consisting of equity and loan stock, is based on recent investment price, net assets and cost. For the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has considered the reasonable possible alternative input assumptions on the valuation of the portfolio and believes that changes to inputs (by adjusting the earnings and revenue multiples) could lead to a change in the fair value of the portfolio. Therefore, for the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has adjusted the inputs for a number of the largest portfolio companies (by value) resulting in a total coverage of 84% of the portfolio of investments. The main inputs considered for each type of valuation is as follows:\\n\\n* As detailed in the accounting policies above, the base case is based on market comparables, discounted where appropriate for marketability, in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\\n\\nThe impact of these changes could result in an overall increase in the valuation of the unquoted equity investments by \\u00a3997,000 (1.7%) or a decrease in the valuation of unquoted equity investments by \\u00a3984,000 (1.7%). Due to the size of the holding in Quantexa, a 10% change in this valuation would result in a movement of \\u00a31,694,000 (1.8%).\\n\\n12. Significant interests\\n\\nThe principal activity of the Company is to select and hold a portfolio of investments in unquoted securities. Although the Company, through the Manager, will, in some cases, be represented on the board of the portfolio company, it will not take a controlling interest or become involved in the management of a portfolio company. The size and structure of the companies with unquoted securities may result in certain holdings in the portfolio representing a participating interest without there being any partnership, joint venture or management consortium agreement.\\n\\nThe Company has no interests of greater than 20% of the nominal value of any class of the allotted shares in the portfolio companies as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\n13. Trade and other receivables\\n\\nThe deferred consideration under one year includes deferred proceeds from the sale of G.Network Communications in December 2020. These proceeds are receivable in January 2024, and have been discounted to present value at the prevailing market rate, including a provision for counterparty risk. This constitutes a financing transaction, and has been accounted for using the policy disclosed in note 2.\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of receivables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n14. Trade and other payables\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of payables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n15. Called-up share capital\\n\\nThe Company purchased 7,462,975 Ordinary shares for treasury (2022: 6,926,930) during the year at a total cost of \\u00a32,359,000 (2022: \\u00a32,212,000).\\n\\nThe total number of shares held in treasury as at 30 June 2023 was 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916) representing 13.2% of the shares in issue as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme Circular dated 26 February 2009, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were allotted during the year:\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Albion VCTs' Prospectus Top Up Offers 2022/23, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were issued during the year:\\n\\n16. Basic and diluted net asset value per share\\n\\nThe basic and diluted net asset value per share at the year end is calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association and are based upon total shares in issue (adjusted for treasury shares) of 283,598,815 shares as at 30 June 2023 (2022: 254,700,921).\\n\\n17. Capital and financial instruments risk management\\n\\nThe Company's capital comprises Ordinary shares as described in note 15. The Company is permitted to buy back its own shares for cancellation or treasury purposes.\\n\\nThe Company's financial instruments comprise equity and loan stock investments in quoted and unquoted companies, cash balances and short term receivables and payables which arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to generate cash flow, revenue and capital appreciation for the Company's operations. The Company has no gearing or other financial liabilities apart from short term payables. The Company does not use any derivatives for the management of its Balance sheet.\\n\\nThe principal risks arising from the Company's operations are:\\n\\nThe Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. There have been no changes in the nature of the risks that the Company has faced during the past year and there have been no changes in the objectives, policies or processes for managing risks during the past year. The key risks are summarised below:\\n\\nMarket risk\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, it is the Company's specific nature to evaluate the market risk of its portfolio in unquoted companies. Market risk is the exposure of the Company to the revaluation and devaluation of investments as a result of macroeconomic changes. The main driver of market risk is the dynamics of market quoted comparators, as well as the financial and operational performance of portfolio companies. The Board seeks to reduce this risk by having a spread of investments across a variety of sectors. More details on the sectors the Company invests in can be found in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review market risk, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Board monitors the prices at which sales of investments are made to ensure that profits to the Company are maximised, and that valuations of investments retained within the portfolio appear sufficiently prudent and realistic compared to prices being achieved in the market for sales of unquoted investments.\\n\\nAs required under FRS 102 the Board is required to illustrate by way of a sensitivity analysis the extent to which the assets are exposed to market risk. In order to show the impact of sensitivity in market movements on the Company, a 10% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by \\u00a36,800,000. Accordingly, a 20% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by \\u00a313,600,000. Further sensitivity analysis on fixed asset investments is included in note 11.\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk)\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk) is the risk that the fair value of future investment cash flows will fluctuate due to factors specific to an investment instrument or to a market in similar instruments. The management of risk within the venture capital portfolio is addressed through careful investment selection, by diversification across different industry segments, by maintaining a wide spread of holdings in terms of financing stage and by limitation of the size of individual holdings. The Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment risk. The Directors monitor the Manager's compliance with the investment policy, review and agree policies for managing this risk and monitor the overall level of risk on the investment portfolio on a regular basis.\\n\\nValuations are based on the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. Details of the industries in which investments have been made are contained in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe maximum investment risk on the balance sheet date is the value of the fixed asset investment portfolio which is \\u00a368,000,000 (2022: \\u00a357,170,000). Fixed asset investments form 72% of the net asset value on 30 June 2023 (2022: 67%).\\n\\nInterest rate risk\\n\\nIt is the Company's policy to accept a degree of interest rate risk on its financial assets through the effect of interest rate changes. On the basis of the Company's analysis, it is estimated that a rise of 1% in all interest rates would have increased total return before tax for the year by approximately \\u00a3265,000 (2022: \\u00a3139,000). Furthermore, it was considered that a material fall in interest rates below current levels during the year would have been unlikely.\\n\\nThe weighted average interest rate applied to the Company's fixed rate assets during the year was approximately 7.2% (2022: 10.1%). The weighted average period to maturity for the fixed rate assets is approximately 2.1 years (2022: 2.1 years).\\n\\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities, all denominated in pounds sterling, consist of the following:\\n\\n*The receivables do not reconcile to the Balance sheet as prepayments are not included in the above table.\\n\\nCredit risk\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk through its receivables, investment in unquoted loan stock, and through the holding of cash on deposit with banks.\\n\\nThe Manager evaluates credit risk on loan stock and other similar instruments prior to investment, and as part of its ongoing monitoring of investments. In doing this, it takes into account the extent and quality of any security held. For loan stock investments made prior to 6 April 2018, which account for 78.4% of loan stock by value, typically loan stock instruments have a fixed or floating charge, which may or may not have been subordinated, over the assets of the portfolio company in order to mitigate the gross credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies, and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment-specific credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review credit risk (including receivables) and other risks, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Company's total gross credit risk at 30 June 2023 was limited to \\u00a310,272,000 of unquoted loan stock instruments (2022: \\u00a38,961,000), \\u00a325,006,000 cash deposits with banks (2022: \\u00a328,024,000) and \\u00a31,646,000 of other receivables (2022: \\u00a31,835,000).\\n\\nAt the balance sheet date, the cash in bank and at hand held by the Company was held with Lloyds Bank Plc, Scottish Widows Bank plc (part of Lloyds Banking Group), Barclays Bank plc, National Westminster Bank plc and Bank of Montreal. Credit risk on cash transactions was mitigated by transacting with counterparties that are regulated entities subject to prudential supervision, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.\\n\\nThe Company has an informal policy limiting counterparty banking and floating rate note exposure to a maximum of 20% of net asset value for any one counterparty.\\n\\nThe credit profile of unquoted loan stock is described under liquidity risk.\\n\\nLiquidity risk\\n\\nLiquid assets are held as cash on current account, on deposit or short term money market account. Under the terms of its Articles, the Company has the ability to borrow up to the amount of its adjusted capital and reserves of the latest published audited Balance sheet, which amounts to \\u00a391,615,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a383,700,000).\\n\\nThe Company has no committed borrowing facilities as at 30 June 2023 (2022: nil) and had cash balances of \\u00a325,006,000 (2022: \\u00a328,024,000). The main cash outflows are for new investments, dividends and share buy-backs, which are within the control of the Company. The Manager formally reviews the cash requirements of the Company on a monthly basis, and the Board on a quarterly basis, as part of its review of management accounts and forecasts. All of the Company's financial liabilities are short term in nature and total \\u00a3721,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a31,224,000).\\n\\nThe carrying value of loan stock investments as analysed by expected maturity dates is as follows:\\n\\nLoan stock can be past due as a result of interest or capital not being paid in accordance with contractual terms. The cost of loan stock investments valued below cost is \\u00a3nil (2022: \\u00a3681,000).\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as the result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both those valued below cost and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nIn view of the availability of adequate cash balances and the repayment profile of loan stock investments, the Board considers that the Company is subject to low liquidity risk.\\n\\nFair values of financial assets and financial liabilities\\n\\nAll the Company's financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2023 are stated at fair value as determined by the Directors, with the exception of receivables, payables and cash which are carried at amortised cost. There are no financial liabilities other than payables. The Company's financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing. It is the Directors' opinion that the book value of the financial liabilities is not materially different to the fair value and all are payable within one year.\\n\\n18. Commitments and contingencies\\n\\nThe Company had no financial commitments in respect of investments at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a3nil).\\n\\nThere are no contingencies or guarantees of the Company as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a3nil).\\n\\n19. Post balance sheet events\\n\\nSince the year end, the Company has completed the following material investment transactions:\\n\\n20. Related party transactions\\n\\nOther than transactions with the Manager as disclosed in note 5, and the Directors' remuneration disclosed in the Directors' remuneration report on page 61 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements, there are no other related party transactions or balances requiring disclosure.\\n\\n21. Other information\\n\\nThe information set out in this announcement does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts within the terms of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 for the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022, and is derived from the statutory accounts for those financial years, which have been, or in the case of the accounts for the year ended 30 June 2023, which will be, delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Auditor reported on those accounts; the reports were unqualified and did not contain a statement under s498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\\n\\n22. Publication\\n\\nThe full audited Annual Report and Financial Statements are being sent to shareholders and copies will be made available to the public at the registered office of the Company, Companies House, the National Storage Mechanism and also electronically at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN, where the Report can be accessed via a link in the 'Financial Reports and Circulars' section.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"This announcement was approved for release by the Board of Directors on 11 October 2023.\\n\\nThe Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 (which have been audited), will shortly be sent to shareholders. Copies of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements will be shown via the Albion Capital Group LLP website by clicking www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN/30Jun23.pdf.\\n\\nInvestment policy\\n\\nThe Company invests in a broad portfolio of smaller, unquoted growth businesses across a variety of sectors including higher risk technology companies. Investments take the form of equity or a mixture of equity and loans.\\n\\nWhilst allocation of funds is determined by the investment opportunities which are available, efforts are made to ensure that the portfolio is diversified both in terms of sector and stage of maturity of investee businesses. Funds held pending investment or for liquidity purposes will be held principally as cash on deposit.\\n\\nRisk diversification and maximum exposures\\n\\nRisk is spread by investing in a number of different businesses within Venture Capital Trust qualifying industry sectors using a mixture of securities, as permitted. The maximum amount which the Company will invest in a single portfolio company is 15% of the Company's assets at cost thus ensuring a spread of investment risk. The value of an individual investment may increase over time as a result of trading progress and it is possible that it may grow in value to a point where it represents a significantly higher proportion of total assets prior to a realisation opportunity being available.\\n\\nThe Company's maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the amount of its adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not have any intention of utilising long-term gearing.\\n\\n\\u2020These are considered Alternative Performance Measures, see notes 2 and 3 of the Strategic report below for further explanation.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n(i) Prior to 6 April 1999, Venture Capital Trusts were able to add 20% to dividends and figures for the period up until 6 April 1999 are included at the gross equivalent rate actually paid to shareholders.\\n\\nA more detailed breakdown of the dividends paid per year can be found at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN under the 'Dividend History' section.\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share payable on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nChairman's statement\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe year saw the Company's portfolio facing a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop due to high inflation, rising interest rates and political instability which has caused the valuation of quoted technology companies to fall sharply. In spite of this, I am pleased to report an increase in total shareholder value of 1.06 pence per share for the year ended 30 June 2023, representing a 3.1% uplift on the opening net asset value.\\n\\nAlthough the Company's portfolio faces uncertainties, the Board remains encouraged by the progress that is being made by many of the portfolio companies. The Board recognises the importance of evaluating the Company's returns over the longer-term, as a venture capital portfolio can, by its nature, experience periods of short term volatility.\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nAs at 30 June 2023, the net asset value (\\\"NAV\\\") was \\u00a394.0 million or 33.13 pence per share compared with \\u00a385.8 million or 33.70 pence per share at 30 June 2022. The continuing progress of a number of our portfolio companies is discussed later in this statement and in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nIn line with the dividend policy targeting payment of around 5.0% of NAV per annum, the Company paid ordinary dividends of 1.63 pence per share during the year to 30 June 2023, which equates to 4.8% of the opening NAV (30 June 2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share).\\n\\nThe Board is pleased to declare a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share, representing 2.5% of the prevailing NAV, to be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nInvestment performance and progress\\n\\nOur portfolio has performed well despite the global uncertainties faced, and this has contributed to the total uplift in value of \\u00a33.8 million to the Company's investments for the year (30 June 2022: \\u00a36.4 million). Quantexa, the largest company within our portfolio (18% of net asset value), was the main contributor to the net gain, increasing its value by \\u00a36.8 million following an externally led $129 million Series E fundraising which completed in April 2023. Other unrealised gains in the year, again driven by strong trading and revenue growth, included Convertr of \\u00a30.6 million and Solidatus of \\u00a30.5 million. These gains were partially offset by write downs in Black Swan which decreased by \\u00a31.5 million, uMotif by \\u00a30.9 million and Oviva by \\u00a30.8 million.\\n\\nThe Company realised disposal proceeds of \\u00a30.7 million (2022: \\u00a37.2 million). The largest disposals being a part disposal of our shareholding in our AIM quoted investment, Arecor Therapeutics PLC (\\u00a30.3 million) and an exit of Zift (\\u00a30.2 million). There were also several investments written off during the year, however their valuations had already been substantially reduced in previous years and had little impact on the return for the year. Further details on the realisations during the year can be found in the realisations table on page 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe three largest investments in the Company's portfolio, Quantexa, Proveca and Radnor House are valued at \\u00a324.8 million and represent 26.4% of the Company's net asset value. The company regularly monitors its concentration risk and as announced on 6 October 2023, the Company sold \\u00a31.2 million of its holding in Quantexa at its current valuation to reduce its concentration risk.\\n\\nThe Company has been an active investor during the year with \\u00a37.9 million invested in 11 new and 11 existing portfolio companies. The new portfolio companies are expected to require further investment as the companies prove themselves and grow. The following are the five largest new investments:\\n\\nA full list of the Company's investments and disposals, including their movements in value for the year, can be found in the Portfolio of investments section on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nBoard composition\\n\\nI have had the privilege of serving as a Director of the Company for nine years, including three as Chairman, and I will retire at the Annual General Meeting in November 2023. I am delighted that James Agnew, an existing Board member, will succeed me as Chairman.\\n\\nFollowing a formal selection process and as part of its ongoing succession planning, the Board is pleased to welcome Tony Ellingham who joined the Board on 1 September 2023.\\n\\nWhen James Agnew becomes Chairman of the Board, Tony Ellingham will become the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee; Pam Garside will become the Senior Independent Director; and Ian Spence will become Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.\\n\\nRisks and uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company faces a number of significant risks, including higher interest rates, high levels of inflation, the ongoing impact of geopolitical tensions, and an expected period of economic stagnation in the UK and other markets. This complex backdrop is factored into how the Company is managed, including in its management of cash.\\n\\nOur investment portfolio, while concentrated mainly in the technology and healthcare sectors, remains diversified in terms of both sub-sector and stage of maturity and, importantly, we believe it to be appropriately valued.\\n\\nThe Manager is continually assessing the exposure to these risks for each portfolio company and appropriate actions, where possible, are being implemented. This includes the potential provision of further financial support to portfolio companies where necessary.\\n\\nA detailed analysis of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business is shown in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nShare buy-backs and reserves\\n\\nIt remains the Board's primary objective to maintain sufficient resources for investment in existing and new portfolio companies and for the continued payment of dividends to shareholders. The Board's policy is to buy back shares in the market, subject to the overall constraint that such purchases are in the Company's interest. It is the Board's intention for such buy-backs to be in the region of a 5% discount to net asset value, so far as market conditions and liquidity permit.\\n\\nThe Company also manages a relatively high level of distributable reserves which can be used for share buy-backs and the payment of dividends. As in the past, the Company has sought authority from shareholders for the reclassification of the share premium account to create additional distributable reserves, which is being done again this year as explained on page 50 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nAlbion VCTs Prospectus Top Up Offers\\n\\nYour Board, in conjunction with the boards of the other five VCTs managed by Albion Capital Group LLP, launched a prospectus top up Offer of new Ordinary shares on 10 October 2022. On 10 March 2023 the Offer was fully subscribed and closed to further applications raising \\u00a311.5 million including the overallotment facility. The Board was pleased to see the high level of demand for the Company's shares from existing and new shareholders.\\n\\nThe proceeds raised by the Company pursuant to the Offer are added to the liquid resources available for investment, positioning the Company to take advantage of new investment opportunities. Details on the share allotments during the year can be found in note 15.\\n\\nAnnual General Meeting\\n\\nThe AGM will be held virtually at noon on 22 November 2023 via the Lumi platform. Information on how to participate in the live webcast can be found on the Manager's website www.albion.capital/vct-hub/agms-events.\\n\\nThe Board welcomes questions from shareholders at the AGM and shareholders will be able to ask questions using the Lumi platform during the AGM. Alternatively, shareholders can email their questions to crownchair@albion.capital prior to the AGM.\\n\\nShareholders' views are important, and the Board encourages shareholders to vote on the resolutions.\\n\\nFurther details on the format and business to be conducted at the AGM can be found in the Directors' report on pages 49 and 50, and in the Notice of the Meeting on pages 91 and 92, of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nAudit tender process\\n\\nFollowing a formal and rigorous audit tender process, the intention is to appoint Johnston Carmichael LLP (\\\"Johnston Carmichael\\\") as the new Auditor of the Company in October 2023. Johnston Carmichael will conduct the audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024. Shareholders will be asked to confirm the appointment of Johnston Carmichael at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. BDO conducted the audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 and their report can be found on pages 64 to 70 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Board would like to express their gratitude to BDO for their diligent service over 16 years. Further details on the tender process can be found in the Statement of corporate governance on page 56 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nShareholder seminar\\n\\nThe next Shareholder Seminar will be held at the Royal College of Surgeons, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PE on 15 November 2023 and the Board will be delighted to see as many shareholders as possible at the event. The Board and Manager are keen to interact with shareholders and look forward to sharing with you further portfolio updates, as well as answering any questions. Places are limited and to reserve a place please email info@albion.capital with subject heading \\\"Shareholder Seminar\\\" and include your full name. You will receive an email confirmation of your place, subject to availability.\\n\\nMore details are available on the Albion Capital website: www.albion.capital.\\n\\nOutlook and prospects\\n\\nThe Board is encouraged by the positive results for the year just ended in what are uncertain times, principally outside the Company's control. The Board believes the portfolio is well diversified in terms of maturity and target sectors, many of which do not depend on consumer sentiment. Therefore, the Board continues to have confidence that the Company is well positioned in the current economic environment to generate long term value for shareholders.\\n\\nCrown Place VCT PLC (the \\\"Company\\\") is a Venture Capital Trust and its investment policy can be found above.\\n\\nBusiness model\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, the Company has no employees and has outsourced the management of all its operations to Albion Capital Group LLP, including secretarial and administrative services. Further details of the Investment Management Agreement can be found below.\\n\\nCurrent portfolio sector allocation\\n\\nThe pie charts at the end of this announcement are a useful way of showing the split of the portfolio valuation as at 30 June 2023 by: sector; stage of investment measured by revenues; and size measured by number of employees. Details of the principal investments made by the Company are shown in the Portfolio of investments on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nDirection of portfolio\\n\\nThe analysis of the Company's investment portfolio shows that it is well diversified and spread across the FinTech, healthcare (including digital healthcare), software and technology, renewable energy, and education sectors.\\n\\nCash and net current assets are a significant proportion of the portfolio at 28%. The main use of these funds will be to invest in higher growth technology companies, and therefore the shift away from asset based companies will continue. The funds will also be used to pay dividends, buyback shares and for the operating expenses of the Company. The Company has a significant speciality in healthcare, FinTech and software investing, which account for 58% of the net asset value of the Company.\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nThe Company paid dividends totalling 1.63 pence per share during the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: 3.21 pence per share which included a 1.50 pence per share special dividend). The dividend objective of the Board is to provide shareholders with a regular dividend flow. The Board declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This dividend will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nAs shown in the Company's Income statement below, the total return for the year was 1.05 pence per share (2022: 2.09 pence per share). The net asset value decreased to 33.13 pence per share (2022: 33.70 pence per share). This decrease in net asset value was primarily due to the payment of 1.63 pence per share of dividends during the year, partly offset by the total return in the year.\\n\\nInvestment income has increased to \\u00a3936,000 (2022: \\u00a3853,000). This is a result of bank interest and income from fixed term funds increasing to \\u00a3283,000 (2022: \\u00a317,000) as a result of rising interest rates. Loan stock income decreased to \\u00a3569,000 (2022: \\u00a3763,000) as the prior year included a large payment of previously capitalised interest.\\n\\nThe gain on investments for the year was \\u00a33,846,000 (2022: gain of \\u00a36,386,000). The key drivers of this gain are detailed in the Chairman's statement above. A full analysis of the Portfolio of investments can be seen on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe net cash flow for the Company has been a net outflow of \\u00a33,018,000 for the year (2022: inflow of \\u00a3598,000), reflecting new investments, dividends paid, ongoing expenses and the buy-back of shares, offset by disposal proceeds, loan stock income, and the issue of new Ordinary shares under the Top Up Offer.\\n\\nReview of the business and future changes\\n\\nA detailed review of the Company's business during the year is contained in the Chairman's statement above.\\n\\nThere is a continuing focus on growing the healthcare (including digital healthcare), FinTech and software and other technology sectors. The majority of these investment returns are delivered through equity and capital gains and are expected to be the key driver of success for the Company. Investment income, which is received primarily from our renewable energy investments, is expected to remain steady over the coming years.\\n\\nDetails of significant events which have occurred since the end of the financial year are listed in note 19. Details of transactions with the Manager are shown in note 5.\\n\\nFuture prospects\\n\\nThe Company's financial results for the year ended 30 June 2023 demonstrate that the portfolio remains well balanced across sectors and risk classes, and is largely weathering the ongoing global issues caused as a result of high levels of interest rates and inflation, and other economic headwinds. Although there remains much uncertainty, the Board considers that the current portfolio and the pipeline of opportunities should enable the Company to maintain a predictable stream of dividend payments to shareholders, as well as delivering long term growth for shareholders. Further details on the Company's outlook and prospects can be found in the Chairman's statement above.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators (\\\"KPIs\\\") and Alternative Performance Measures (\\\"APMs\\\")\\n\\nThe Directors believe that the following KPIs (some of which are APMs), which are typical for Venture Capital Trusts, used in its own assessment of the Company, will provide shareholders with sufficient information to assess how effectively the Company is applying its investment policy to meet its objectives. The Directors are satisfied that the results shown in the following KPIs and APMs give a good indication that the Company is achieving its investment objective and policy. These are:\\n\\nThe graph on page 8 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements shows the Company's total shareholder value relative to the FTSE All-Share Index total return, with dividends reinvested. The FTSE All-Share Index is considered a reasonable benchmark as the Company is classed as a generalist UK VCT investor, and this index includes over 600 companies listed in the UK, including small-cap, covering a range of sectors. Details on the performance of the net asset value and return per share for the year are shown in the Chairman's statement.\\n\\nTotal shareholder value increased by 1.06 pence per share to 101.31 pence per share (2022: 100.25) for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\n2. Movement in shareholder value in the year \\u2020\\n\\n\\u2020 Methodology: Calculated as the movement in total shareholder value for the year divided by the opening net asset value.\\n\\n3. Dividend distributions\\n\\nDividends paid in respect of the year ended 30 June 2023 were 1.63 pence per share (2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share). Cumulative dividends paid since launch (on 18 January 1998) amount to 68.18 pence per share.\\n\\n4. Ongoing charges\\n\\nThe ongoing charges ratio for the year ended 30 June 2023 was 2.20% (2022: 2.18%). The ongoing charges ratio has been calculated using The Association of Investment Companies' (\\\"AIC\\\") recommended methodology. This figure shows shareholders the total recurring annual running expenses (including investment management fees charged to capital reserve, but excluding any performance incentive fees) as a percentage of the average net assets attributable to shareholders. The Directors expect the ongoing charges ratio for the year ahead to remain stable at approximately 2.20%.\\n\\n5. VCT compliance*\\n\\nThe investment policy is designed to ensure that the Company continues to qualify and is approved as a VCT by HMRC. In order to maintain its status under Venture Capital Trust legislation, a VCT must comply on a continuing basis with the provisions of Section 274 of the Income Tax Act 2007, details of which are provided in the Directors' report on page 46 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe relevant tests to measure compliance have been carried out and independently reviewed for the year ended 30 June 2023. These showed that the Company has complied with all tests and continues to do so.\\n\\n*VCT compliance is not a numerical measure of performance and thus cannot be defined as an APM.\\n\\nGearing\\n\\nAs defined by the Articles of Association, the Company's maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not currently have any intention to utilise gearing for the Company.\\n\\nOperational arrangements\\n\\nThe Company has delegated the investment management of the portfolio to the Manager, Albion Capital Group LLP, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The Manager also provides company secretarial and other accounting and administrative support to the Company.\\n\\nInvestment Management Agreement\\n\\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement (\\\"IMA\\\"), the Manager provides investment management, secretarial and administrative services to the Company. The IMA can be terminated by either party on 12 months' notice and is subject to earlier termination in the event of certain breaches or on the insolvency of either party. The Manager is paid an annual fee equal to 1.75% of the net asset value of the Company, and an annual secretarial and administrative fee of \\u00a350,000 per annum. Total annual expenses, including the management fee, are limited to 3% of the net asset value.\\n\\nIn some instances, the Manager is entitled to an arrangement fee, payable by a portfolio company in which the Company invests, in the region of 2.0% of the investment made, and also monitoring fees where the Manager has a representative on the portfolio company's board.\\n\\nManagement performance incentive fee\\n\\nIn order to align the interests of the Manager and shareholders with regards to generating positive returns, the Manager is entitled to charge an incentive fee in the event that the returns exceed minimum target levels. Under the incentive arrangements, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Manager of an amount equal to 20% of such excess return that is calculated for each financial year.\\n\\nThe performance hurdle requires that the growth of the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period (both revenue and capital), compared with the previous accounting date, exceeds the average base rate of the Royal Bank of Scotland plc plus 2.0%. If the target return is not achieved in a period, the cumulative shortfall is carried forward to the next accounting period and has to be made up before an incentive fee becomes payable.\\n\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023, the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period amounted to 34.76 pence per share, compared to a hurdle of 35.69 pence per share. As a result, no performance incentive fee is payable to the Manager (2022: \\u00a3584,000).\\n\\nInvestment and co-investment\\n\\nThe Company co-invests with other Venture Capital Trusts and funds managed by the Manager. Allocation of investments is on the basis of an allocation agreement which is based, inter alia, on the ratio of funds available for investment.\\n\\nEvaluation of the Manager\\n\\nThe Board has evaluated the performance of the Manager based on:\\n\\n* the returns generated by the Company;\\n\\n* the continuing achievement of the HMRC tests for VCT status;\\n\\n* the long term prospects of the current portfolio of investments;\\n\\n* the management of treasury, including use of buy-backs and participation in fund raising; and\\n\\n* benchmarking the performance of the Manager to other service providers including the performance of other VCTs that the Manager is responsible for managing.\\n\\nThe Board believes that it is in the interests of shareholders as a whole, and of the Company, to continue the appointment of the Manager for the forthcoming year.\\n\\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\\\"AIFMD\\\")\\n\\nThe Board appointed the Manager as the Company's AIFM in 2014 as required by the AIFMD. The Manager is a full-scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the AIFMD. Ocorian Depositary (UK) Limited is the appointed Depositary and oversees the custody and cash arrangements and provides other AIFMD duties with respect to the Company.\\n\\nConsumer duty\\n\\nThe Consumer Duty came into effect from 31 July 2023. These new rules set a higher standard of consumer protection in financial services. The Manager as AIFM is within scope of the FCA's Consumer Duty, but the Company itself is not.\\n\\nThe Manager is a manufacturer of the Company's shares as it is a firm that has some influence over design and distribution of the Company's share product. The Manager's first assessment of value for the Company's shares was completed in April 2023. The value assessment concluded that the Company provides fair value for shareholders.\\n\\nWhere the Manager concludes that changes will help deliver good outcomes for consumers, it will recommend these changes to the Board.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006 Section 172 Reporting\\n\\nUnder Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Board has a duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole in both the long and short term, having regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Company, such as suppliers, and to do so with an understanding of the impact on the community and environment and with high standards of business conduct, which includes acting fairly between members of the Company.\\n\\nThe Board is very conscious of these wider responsibilities in the ways it promotes the Company's culture and ensures, as part of its regular oversight, that the integrity of the Company's affairs is foremost in the way the activities are managed and promoted. This includes regular engagement with the wider stakeholders of the Company and being alert to issues that might damage the Company's standing in the way that it operates. The Board works very closely with the Manager in reviewing how stakeholder issues are handled, ensuring good governance and responsibility in managing the Company's affairs, as well as visibility and openness in how the affairs are conducted.\\n\\nThe Company is an externally managed investment company with no employees, and as such has nothing to report in relation to employee engagement but does keep close attention to how the Board operates as a cohesive and competent unit. The Company also has no customers in the traditional sense and, therefore, there is also nothing to report in relation to relationships with customers.\\n\\nThe table that follows sets out the key stakeholders, details how the Board has engaged with these key stakeholders, and the effect of these considerations on the Company's decisions and strategies during the year.\\n\\nSocial and community issues, employees and human rights\\n\\nThe Board recognises the requirement under section 414C of the Act to detail information about social and community issues, employees and human rights; including any policies it has in relation to these matters and effectiveness of these policies. As an externally managed investment company with no employees, the Company has no formal policies in these matters, however, it is at the core of its responsible investment strategy as detailed above.\\n\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\\\"GDPR\\\") has the objective of unifying data privacy requirements across the European Union. GDPR forms part of the UK law after Brexit, now known as UK GDPR. The Manager continues to take action to ensure that the Manager and the Company are compliant with the regulation.\\n\\nFurther policies\\n\\nThe Company has adopted a number of further policies relating to:\\n\\nand these are set out in the Directors' report on page 47 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nRisk management\\n\\nThe Board carries out a regular review of the risk environment in which the Company operates, together with changes to the environment and individual risks. The Board also identifies emerging risks which might impact on the Company. In the period the most noticeable risks have been rising interest rates and inflation, caused in part as a result of the geopolitical tensions, and pricing volatility in world markets, particularly affecting growth stocks. The full impact of these risks are likely to continue to be uncertain for some time.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the Company's principal risks and uncertainties and seeks to mitigate these risks through regular reviews of performance and monitoring progress and compliance. The Board applies the principles detailed in the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, in the mitigation and management of these risks. More information on specific mitigation measures for the principal risks and uncertainties are explained below:\\n\\nViability statement\\n\\nIn accordance with the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2018 and provision 36 of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over three years to 30 June 2026. The Directors believe that three years is a reasonable period in which they can assess the ability of the Company to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. This is the period used by the Board as part of its strategic planning process, which includes: the estimated timelines for finding, assessing and completing investments; the potential impact of any new regulations; and the availability of cash.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company, including those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, and focused on the major factors which affect the economic, regulatory and political environment. The Board carefully assessed, and were satisfied with, the risk management processes in place to avoid or reduce the impact of these risks. The Board has carried out robust stress testing of cashflows which included; factoring in higher levels of inflation when budgeting for future expenses, only including proceeds from investment disposals where there is a high probability of completion, whilst also assessing the requirement for any future financial support of portfolio companies.\\n\\nThe Board has additionally considered the ability of the Company to comply with the ongoing conditions to ensure it maintains its VCT qualifying status under its current investment policy. As a result of the Board's quarterly valuation reviews, it has concluded that the portfolio is well balanced and geared towards delivering long term growth and strong returns to shareholders.\\n\\nThe Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to 30 June 2026. The Board is mindful of the ongoing risks and will continue to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, in addition to monitoring the quarterly cashflow forecasts to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006\\n\\nThis Strategic report of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2023 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 (the \\\"Act\\\"). The purpose of this report is to provide Shareholders with sufficient information to enable them to assess the extent to which the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the Company in accordance with Section 172 of the Act.\\n\\nIn preparing these Financial Statements for the year to 30 June 2023, the Directors of the Company, being Penny Freer, James Agnew, Tony Ellingham, Pam Garside and Ian Spence, confirm to the best of their knowledge:\\n\\nWe consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\\n\\nA detailed \\\"Statement of Directors' responsibilities\\\" is contained on page 52 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe total column of this Income statement represents the profit and loss account of the Company. The supplementary revenue and capital columns are prepared under guidance published by The Association of Investment Companies.\\n\\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these Financial Statements.\\n\\nThese Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors, and authorised for issue on 11 October 2023 and were signed on its behalf by\\n\\n* Included within these reserves is an amount of \\u00a312,804,000 (2022: \\u00a324,165,000) which is considered distributable.\\n\\nThe nature of each reserve is described in note 2 below.\\n\\nStatement of cash flows\\n\\n* Purchases and disposals detailed above do not agree to note 11 due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\n** The cost of issue of equity does not agree to the Statement of changes in equity due to prospectus fundraising amounts being received net of fees.\\n\\n*** The equity dividends paid shown in the cash flow are different to the dividends disclosed in note 9 as a result of the non-cash effect of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme.\\n\\nNotes to the Financial Statements\\n\\n1. Basis of preparation\\n\\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 (\\\"FRS 102\\\"), and with the Statement of Recommended Practice \\\"Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts\\\" (\\\"SORP\\\") issued by The Association of Investment Companies (\\\"AIC\\\"). The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and further details can be found in the Directors' report on page 45 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The most critical estimates and judgements relate to the determination of carrying value of investments at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (\\\"FVTPL\\\") in accordance with FRS 102 sections 11 and 12. The Company values investments by following the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (\\\"IPEV\\\") Guidelines as updated in 2022 and further detail on the valuation techniques used are outlined below.\\n\\nCompany information is shown on page 4 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\n2. Accounting policies\\n\\nFixed asset investments\\n\\nThe Company's business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth. This portfolio of financial assets is managed, and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment policy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board.\\n\\nIn accordance with the requirements of FRS 102, those undertakings in which the Company holds more than 20% of the equity as part of an investment portfolio are not accounted for using the equity method. In these circumstances the investment is measured at FVTPL.\\n\\nUpon initial recognition (using trade date accounting) investments, including loan stock, are classified by the Company as FVTPL and are included at their initial fair value, which is cost (excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off to the Income statement).\\n\\nSubsequently, the investments are valued at 'fair value', which is measured as follows:\\n\\nInvestments are recognised as financial assets on legal completion of the investment contract and are de-recognised on legal completion of the sale of an investment.\\n\\nDividend income is not recognised as part of the fair value movement of an investment, but is recognised separately as investment income through the other distributable reserve when a share becomes ex-dividend.\\n\\nCurrent assets and payables\\n\\nReceivables (including debtors due after more than one year), payables and cash are carried at amortised cost, in accordance with FRS 102. Deferred consideration meets the definition of a financing transaction held at amortised cost, and interest will be recognised through capital over the credit period using the effective interest method. There are no financial liabilities other than payables.\\n\\nInvestment income\\n\\nDividend income\\n\\nDividend income is included in revenue when the investment is quoted ex-dividend.\\n\\nUnquoted loan stock income\\n\\nFixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised when the Company's right to receive payment and expect settlement is established. Where interest is rolled up and/or payable at redemption then it is recognised as income unless there is reasonable doubt as to its receipt.\\n\\nFixed term funds income\\n\\nFunds income is recognised on an accruals basis using the agreed rate of interest.\\n\\nBank deposit income\\n\\nInterest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the rate of interest agreed with the bank.\\n\\nInvestment management fee, performance incentive fee and other expenses\\n\\nAll expenses have been accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged through the other distributable reserve except the following which are charged through the realised capital reserve:\\n\\nTaxation\\n\\nTaxation is applied on a current basis in accordance with FRS 102. Current tax is tax payable (refundable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the current period or past reporting periods using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the financial reporting date. Taxation associated with capital expenses is applied in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences at the reporting date. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements. As a VCT the Company has an exemption from tax on capital gains. The Company intends to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval as a VCT in the foreseeable future. The Company therefore, should have no material deferred tax timing differences arising in respect of the revaluation or disposal of investments and the Company has not provided for any deferred tax.\\n\\nReserves\\n\\nCalled-up share capital\\n\\nThis accounts for the nominal value of the Company's shares.\\n\\nShare premium\\n\\nThis accounts for the difference between the price paid for shares and the nominal value of the shares, less issue costs and transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nCapital redemption reserve\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for amounts by which the issued share capital is diminished through the repurchase and cancellation of the Company's own shares, less any transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nUnrealised capital reserve\\n\\nIncreases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end against cost are included in this reserve.\\n\\nRealised capital reserve\\n\\nThe following are disclosed in this reserve:\\n\\nOther distributable reserve\\n\\nThe special reserve, treasury share reserve and the revenue reserve were combined in 2012 to form a single reserve named other distributable reserve.\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for movements from the revenue column of the Income statement, the payment of dividends, the buy-back of shares, transfers from the share premium and capital redemption reserve, and other non-capital realised movements.\\n\\nDividends\\n\\nDividends by the Company are accounted for when the liability to make the payment (record date) has been established.\\n\\nSegmental reporting\\n\\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single operating segment of business, being investment in smaller companies principally based in the UK.\\n\\nFurther details of the Investment Management Agreement under which the investment manager's fee is paid are given in the Strategic report above.\\n\\nDuring the year, services of a total value of \\u00a31,583,000 (2022: \\u00a31,425,000) were purchased by the Company from Albion Capital Group LLP (\\\"Albion\\\") comprising \\u00a31,533,000 of management fees (2022: \\u00a31,375,000) and \\u00a350,000 of administration fees (2022: \\u00a350,000). There is no performance incentive fee payable this year (2022: \\u00a3584,000). At the financial year end, the amount due to Albion in respect of these services disclosed as accruals and deferred income was \\u00a3422,500 (administration fee accrual: \\u00a312,500, management fee accrual \\u00a3410,000) (2022: \\u00a3971,500).\\n\\nAlbion is, from time to time, eligible to receive an arrangement fee and monitoring fees from portfolio companies. During the year ended 30 June 2023 fees of \\u00a3299,000 attributable to the investments of the Company were received pursuant to these arrangements (2022: \\u00a3121,000).\\n\\nAlbion, its partners and staff holds 2,385,697 Ordinary shares in the Company as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThe Company entered into an offer agreement relating to the Offers pursuant to which Albion received a fee of 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the Offers and out of which Albion paid the costs of the Offers, as detailed in the Prospectus.\\n\\n6. Other expenses\\n\\n7. Directors' fees\\n\\nThe amounts paid to and on behalf of the Directors during the year are as follows:\\n\\nThe Company's key management personnel are the Directors. Further information regarding Directors' remuneration can be found in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 61 and 62 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe tax charge for the year shown in the Income statement is lower than the average standard rate of corporation tax of 20.50% (2022: 19.0%). The differences are explained above. From 1 April 2023, the Company's rate of corporation tax increased from 19% to 25%.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n(i) Venture Capital Trusts are not subject to corporation tax on capital gains.\\n\\n(ii) Tax relief on expenses charged to capital has been determined by allocating tax relief to expenses by reference to the applicable corporation tax rate and allocating the relief between revenue and capital in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\n(iii) The Company has excess management expenses of \\u00a321,392,000 (2022: \\u00a320,279,000) that are available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of \\u00a35,348,000 (2022: \\u00a33,853,000) has not been recognised in respect of these losses as they will be recoverable only to the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable profits.\\n\\n9. Dividends\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023. The total dividend will be approximately \\u00a32,354,000. All dividends are paid from the other distributable reserve.\\n\\nDuring the year, unclaimed dividends older than twelve years of \\u00a313,000 (2022: \\u00a313,000) were returned to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Association and have been accounted for on an accruals basis.\\n\\n10. Basic and diluted return per share\\n\\nThe weighted average number of shares is calculated after adjusting for treasury shares of 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916).\\n\\nThere are no convertible instruments, derivatives or contingent share agreements in issue so basic and diluted return/(loss) per share are the same.\\n\\nPurchases and disposals detailed above may not agree to the Statement of cash flows due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as a result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both impaired and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nUnquoted fixed asset investments are valued at fair value in accordance with the IPEV guidelines as follows:\\n\\nWhen using the cost or price of a recent investment in the valuations, the Company looks to re-calibrate this price at each valuation point by reviewing progress within the investment, comparing against the initial investment thesis, assessing if there are any significant events or milestones that would indicate the value of the investment has changed and considering whether a market-based methodology (i.e. using multiples from comparable public companies) or a discounted cashflow forecast would be more appropriate. The background to the transaction is also considered when the price of investment may not be an appropriate measure of fair value, for example, disproportionate dilution of existing investors from a new investor coming on board or the market conditions at the time of investment no longer being a true reflection of fair value.\\n\\nThe main inputs into the calibration exercise, and for the valuation models using multiples, are revenue, EBITDA and P/E multiples (based on the most recent revenue, EBITDA or earnings achieved and equivalent corresponding revenue, EBITDA or earnings multiples of comparable companies), quality of earnings assessments and comparability difference adjustments. Revenue multiples are often used, rather than EBITDA or earnings, due to the nature of the Company's investments, being in growth and technology companies which are not normally expected to achieve profitability or scale for a number of years. Where an investment has achieved scale and profitability the Company would normally then expect to switch to using an EBITDA or earnings multiple methodology.\\n\\nIn the calibration exercise and in determining the valuation for the Company's equity instruments, comparable trading multiples are used. In accordance with the Company's policy, appropriate comparable companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation, growth rate and strategy are determined and a trading multiple for each comparable company identified is then calculated. The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its revenue, EBITDA or earnings. The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity, marketability and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.\\n\\nFair value investments had the following movements between valuation methodologies between 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2023:\\n\\nThe valuation will be the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. The Directors believe that, within these parameters, there are no other more relevant methods of valuation which would be reasonable as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nFRS 102 and the SORP requires the Company to disclose the inputs to the valuation methods applied to its investments measured at FVTPL in a fair value hierarchy. The table below sets out fair value hierarchy definitions using FRS 102 s.11.27.\\n\\nQuoted investments are valued according to Level 1 valuation methods. Unquoted equity, preference shares and loan stock are all valued according to Level 3 valuation methods.\\n\\nInvestments held at fair value through profit or loss (Level 3) had the following movements:\\n\\n*Additions and disposals do not agree to the cash flow due to loan stock conversions and non-cash consideration.\\n\\nFRS 102 requires the Directors to consider the impact of changing one or more of the inputs used as part of the valuation process to reasonable possible alternative assumptions. 70% of the portfolio of investments, consisting of equity and loan stock, is based on recent investment price, net assets and cost. For the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has considered the reasonable possible alternative input assumptions on the valuation of the portfolio and believes that changes to inputs (by adjusting the earnings and revenue multiples) could lead to a change in the fair value of the portfolio. Therefore, for the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has adjusted the inputs for a number of the largest portfolio companies (by value) resulting in a total coverage of 84% of the portfolio of investments. The main inputs considered for each type of valuation is as follows:\\n\\n* As detailed in the accounting policies above, the base case is based on market comparables, discounted where appropriate for marketability, in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\\n\\nThe impact of these changes could result in an overall increase in the valuation of the unquoted equity investments by \\u00a3997,000 (1.7%) or a decrease in the valuation of unquoted equity investments by \\u00a3984,000 (1.7%). Due to the size of the holding in Quantexa, a 10% change in this valuation would result in a movement of \\u00a31,694,000 (1.8%).\\n\\n12. Significant interests\\n\\nThe principal activity of the Company is to select and hold a portfolio of investments in unquoted securities. Although the Company, through the Manager, will, in some cases, be represented on the board of the portfolio company, it will not take a controlling interest or become involved in the management of a portfolio company. The size and structure of the companies with unquoted securities may result in certain holdings in the portfolio representing a participating interest without there being any partnership, joint venture or management consortium agreement.\\n\\nThe Company has no interests of greater than 20% of the nominal value of any class of the allotted shares in the portfolio companies as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\n13. Trade and other receivables\\n\\nThe deferred consideration under one year includes deferred proceeds from the sale of G.Network Communications in December 2020. These proceeds are receivable in January 2024, and have been discounted to present value at the prevailing market rate, including a provision for counterparty risk. This constitutes a financing transaction, and has been accounted for using the policy disclosed in note 2.\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of receivables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n14. Trade and other payables\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of payables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n15. Called-up share capital\\n\\nThe Company purchased 7,462,975 Ordinary shares for treasury (2022: 6,926,930) during the year at a total cost of \\u00a32,359,000 (2022: \\u00a32,212,000).\\n\\nThe total number of shares held in treasury as at 30 June 2023 was 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916) representing 13.2% of the shares in issue as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme Circular dated 26 February 2009, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were allotted during the year:\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Albion VCTs' Prospectus Top Up Offers 2022/23, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were issued during the year:\\n\\n16. Basic and diluted net asset value per share\\n\\nThe basic and diluted net asset value per share at the year end is calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association and are based upon total shares in issue (adjusted for treasury shares) of 283,598,815 shares as at 30 June 2023 (2022: 254,700,921).\\n\\n17. Capital and financial instruments risk management\\n\\nThe Company's capital comprises Ordinary shares as described in note 15. The Company is permitted to buy back its own shares for cancellation or treasury purposes.\\n\\nThe Company's financial instruments comprise equity and loan stock investments in quoted and unquoted companies, cash balances and short term receivables and payables which arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to generate cash flow, revenue and capital appreciation for the Company's operations. The Company has no gearing or other financial liabilities apart from short term payables. The Company does not use any derivatives for the management of its Balance sheet.\\n\\nThe principal risks arising from the Company's operations are:\\n\\nThe Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. There have been no changes in the nature of the risks that the Company has faced during the past year and there have been no changes in the objectives, policies or processes for managing risks during the past year. The key risks are summarised below:\\n\\nMarket risk\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, it is the Company's specific nature to evaluate the market risk of its portfolio in unquoted companies. Market risk is the exposure of the Company to the revaluation and devaluation of investments as a result of macroeconomic changes. The main driver of market risk is the dynamics of market quoted comparators, as well as the financial and operational performance of portfolio companies. The Board seeks to reduce this risk by having a spread of investments across a variety of sectors. More details on the sectors the Company invests in can be found in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review market risk, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Board monitors the prices at which sales of investments are made to ensure that profits to the Company are maximised, and that valuations of investments retained within the portfolio appear sufficiently prudent and realistic compared to prices being achieved in the market for sales of unquoted investments.\\n\\nAs required under FRS 102 the Board is required to illustrate by way of a sensitivity analysis the extent to which the assets are exposed to market risk. In order to show the impact of sensitivity in market movements on the Company, a 10% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by \\u00a36,800,000. Accordingly, a 20% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by \\u00a313,600,000. Further sensitivity analysis on fixed asset investments is included in note 11.\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk)\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk) is the risk that the fair value of future investment cash flows will fluctuate due to factors specific to an investment instrument or to a market in similar instruments. The management of risk within the venture capital portfolio is addressed through careful investment selection, by diversification across different industry segments, by maintaining a wide spread of holdings in terms of financing stage and by limitation of the size of individual holdings. The Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment risk. The Directors monitor the Manager's compliance with the investment policy, review and agree policies for managing this risk and monitor the overall level of risk on the investment portfolio on a regular basis.\\n\\nValuations are based on the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. Details of the industries in which investments have been made are contained in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe maximum investment risk on the balance sheet date is the value of the fixed asset investment portfolio which is \\u00a368,000,000 (2022: \\u00a357,170,000). Fixed asset investments form 72% of the net asset value on 30 June 2023 (2022: 67%).\\n\\nInterest rate risk\\n\\nIt is the Company's policy to accept a degree of interest rate risk on its financial assets through the effect of interest rate changes. On the basis of the Company's analysis, it is estimated that a rise of 1% in all interest rates would have increased total return before tax for the year by approximately \\u00a3265,000 (2022: \\u00a3139,000). Furthermore, it was considered that a material fall in interest rates below current levels during the year would have been unlikely.\\n\\nThe weighted average interest rate applied to the Company's fixed rate assets during the year was approximately 7.2% (2022: 10.1%). The weighted average period to maturity for the fixed rate assets is approximately 2.1 years (2022: 2.1 years).\\n\\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities, all denominated in pounds sterling, consist of the following:\\n\\n*The receivables do not reconcile to the Balance sheet as prepayments are not included in the above table.\\n\\nCredit risk\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk through its receivables, investment in unquoted loan stock, and through the holding of cash on deposit with banks.\\n\\nThe Manager evaluates credit risk on loan stock and other similar instruments prior to investment, and as part of its ongoing monitoring of investments. In doing this, it takes into account the extent and quality of any security held. For loan stock investments made prior to 6 April 2018, which account for 78.4% of loan stock by value, typically loan stock instruments have a fixed or floating charge, which may or may not have been subordinated, over the assets of the portfolio company in order to mitigate the gross credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies, and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment-specific credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review credit risk (including receivables) and other risks, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Company's total gross credit risk at 30 June 2023 was limited to \\u00a310,272,000 of unquoted loan stock instruments (2022: \\u00a38,961,000), \\u00a325,006,000 cash deposits with banks (2022: \\u00a328,024,000) and \\u00a31,646,000 of other receivables (2022: \\u00a31,835,000).\\n\\nAt the balance sheet date, the cash in bank and at hand held by the Company was held with Lloyds Bank Plc, Scottish Widows Bank plc (part of Lloyds Banking Group), Barclays Bank plc, National Westminster Bank plc and Bank of Montreal. Credit risk on cash transactions was mitigated by transacting with counterparties that are regulated entities subject to prudential supervision, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.\\n\\nThe Company has an informal policy limiting counterparty banking and floating rate note exposure to a maximum of 20% of net asset value for any one counterparty.\\n\\nThe credit profile of unquoted loan stock is described under liquidity risk.\\n\\nLiquidity risk\\n\\nLiquid assets are held as cash on current account, on deposit or short term money market account. Under the terms of its Articles, the Company has the ability to borrow up to the amount of its adjusted capital and reserves of the latest published audited Balance sheet, which amounts to \\u00a391,615,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a383,700,000).\\n\\nThe Company has no committed borrowing facilities as at 30 June 2023 (2022: nil) and had cash balances of \\u00a325,006,000 (2022: \\u00a328,024,000). The main cash outflows are for new investments, dividends and share buy-backs, which are within the control of the Company. The Manager formally reviews the cash requirements of the Company on a monthly basis, and the Board on a quarterly basis, as part of its review of management accounts and forecasts. All of the Company's financial liabilities are short term in nature and total \\u00a3721,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a31,224,000).\\n\\nThe carrying value of loan stock investments as analysed by expected maturity dates is as follows:\\n\\nLoan stock can be past due as a result of interest or capital not being paid in accordance with contractual terms. The cost of loan stock investments valued below cost is \\u00a3nil (2022: \\u00a3681,000).\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as the result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both those valued below cost and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nIn view of the availability of adequate cash balances and the repayment profile of loan stock investments, the Board considers that the Company is subject to low liquidity risk.\\n\\nFair values of financial assets and financial liabilities\\n\\nAll the Company's financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2023 are stated at fair value as determined by the Directors, with the exception of receivables, payables and cash which are carried at amortised cost. There are no financial liabilities other than payables. The Company's financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing. It is the Directors' opinion that the book value of the financial liabilities is not materially different to the fair value and all are payable within one year.\\n\\n18. Commitments and contingencies\\n\\nThe Company had no financial commitments in respect of investments at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a3nil).\\n\\nThere are no contingencies or guarantees of the Company as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00a3nil).\\n\\n19. Post balance sheet events\\n\\nSince the year end, the Company has completed the following material investment transactions:\\n\\n20. Related party transactions\\n\\nOther than transactions with the Manager as disclosed in note 5, and the Directors' remuneration disclosed in the Directors' remuneration report on page 61 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements, there are no other related party transactions or balances requiring disclosure.\\n\\n21. Other information\\n\\nThe information set out in this announcement does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts within the terms of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 for the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022, and is derived from the statutory accounts for those financial years, which have been, or in the case of the accounts for the year ended 30 June 2023, which will be, delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Auditor reported on those accounts; the reports were unqualified and did not contain a statement under s498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\\n\\n22. Publication\\n\\nThe full audited Annual Report and Financial Statements are being sent to shareholders and copies will be made available to the public at the registered office of the Company, Companies House, the National Storage Mechanism and also electronically at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN, where the Report can be accessed via a link in the 'Financial Reports and Circulars' section.\",\n",

Pradeepkumar\\n\\nG. Pradeepkumar, CEO, Union Asset Management Company Pvt LTD-\\n\\n\\\"The sustained robust inflows into equity funds demonstrate the underlying positive sentiments of investors. The SIP flows continue to be good and could act as a powerful counterforce against any serious FPI outflows. However, given the rich valuations in mid and small cap stocks, we would advise investors to take a staggered approach to investments.\\\"\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 15:13Kislay Upadhyay, smallcase manager and Founder of FidelFolio Investments\\n\\nDespite Foreign Portfolio Investors turning pessimistic towards equity for first time in months due to US yield increase and global challenges, equity remains a magnet for inflows, signalling a sustained shift in Indian investors' risk appetite. This move towards aggressive risk allocation is evident in the heavy outflow from debt funds, particularly pure debt funds, while hybrid funds experience a windfall of inflows. Investors are increasingly favouring dynamic asset allocation over traditional pure debt funds.\\n\\n1. Equity Inflows despite FPI playing dampener:\\n\\nEquity continues its upward trajectory with a \\u20b914,000 crore inflow, marking the second-highest in the last six months\\n\\nAmong equity, every category witnessed inflow, except Large-cap funds\\n\\nNumber of folios continues to rise for active equities, hybrid, and index funds & ETFs, indicating equity being favoured by small and large investors\\n\\nPassive funds maintain a consistent increase in their net inflow month over month\\n\\n2. Continued Debt Fund Challenges indicate changing risk perspective of institutional & individual investors:\\n\\nDebt funds face a substantial outflow of ~\\u20b91 trillion, the highest in the last six months\\n\\nTotal Assets Under Management (AUM) witness a significant decline for debt funds, while hybrid funds saw windfall inflow and all categories of equity funds experience growth (except large cap)\\n\\nEven in terms of number of folios, debt funds saw significant decline.\\n\\n3. Hybrid Funds and Dynamic Asset Allocation shine in both volume and value:\\n\\nMulti-asset allocation hybrid funds record a remarkable 16% MoM increase in number of folios, leading to a corresponding AUM surge of 19% MoM\\n\\n4. Smallcap still favourite of small investors, large investors show slight risk-off:\\n\\nSmall investors gravitate towards small-cap funds, evident in the highest increase in the number of folios (6% MOM). This is 4th consecutive rise of 6% in number of folios in smallcap funds\\n\\nLarger investors exhibit a risk-off approach. Though number of folios increase was highest in smallcap categories, net inflows was higher in sectoral funds alone, and multi cap & flexi cap combined\\n\\n5. Bullish Fund House Perspectives on mutlicap and sectoral funds:\\n\\nAll active equity categories show growth in the number of folios, with small-cap funds leading at 6%, followed by multicap (4%) and sectoral funds (3%).\\n\\nWhile smallcap and midcap inflows continue, they reduce compared to the previous month, with sectoral/thematic funds emerging as the largest category in terms of net inflow.\\n\\nFund houses are most bullish on multicap, flexi, and sectoral funds, increasing the number of schemes by 3-5%.\\n\\n6. Momentum shows investors have learnt power of systematic investment, and seems they won't forget anytime soon:\\n\\nThe power of systematic investment plans (SIPs) remains evident, with a continued growth to \\u20b916,402 crore, up from \\u20b915,814 crore last month.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 15:05Stock Market Live Updates: Major gainers and losers on the NSE at 3 pm\\n\\nMajor gainers: Hero Motocorp (4.27%); Wipro (3.31%); Grasim (3.13%); Ultratech Cement (2.26%); Reliance (1.70%)\\n\\nMajor losers: HCL Tech (-0.71%); Adani Ports (-0.56%); SBI (-0.43%); TCS (-0.30%); Coal India (-0.28%)\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 15:04Stock Market Live Update: Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on October 11, 2023\\n\\nStocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on October 11, 2023, were 2,365 against 1,292 stocks that declined; 133 stocks remain unchanged.

We also expect a low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit net profit expansion compared to the previous quarter. The company's subdued performance in the June quarter was notably impacted by a substantial decline in Engineering Research & Development (ER&D) revenue, constituting 15.4% of its total revenue, primarily due to project downsizing within the hi-tech and telecom sectors. The forthcoming results will also reflect a contribution to revenue growth from the inorganic acquisition of ASAP as well as an anticipated expansion of EBIT margins by over 50 bps compared to June owing to moderation in sub-contracting costs. Notably, a substantial uptick in net new deals is expected, largely propelled by the Verizon agreement, set to begin contributing from November 2023. The estimated size of the Verizon deal varies between $3 billion-$3.5 billion, significantly exceeding the average of $2 billion over the preceding seven quarters. Key factors of interest include obtaining more insight into the Verizon deal, particularly how the Total Contract Value (TCV) was computed. Furthermore, we would be looking forward to the company's outlook on discretionary spending and the wage hike cycle for FY24.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 14:24MF equity inflows dip 31% on profit-booking in September\\n\\nInflows into equity schemes dipped 31 per cent in September to \\u20b914,019 crore against \\u20b920,245 crore in August as investors preferred to book profits given the global economic uncertainty.\\n\\nThe unique investors identified by individual PAN in industry touched a high of 4 crore, per the data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India on Wednesday.\\n\\nAmong equity schemes, large-cap fund registered an outflow of \\u20b9110 crore last month while all other funds recorded a positive inflow.

This decline is attributed to concerns about an oversupply of zinc relative to demand.\\n\\nThe International Lead and Zinc Study Group reported that the global refined zinc market is expected to have a surplus of 248,000 tonne in the current year. This is a significant shift from a previously projected deficit of 45,000 tonne. The surplus is driven by lower-than-anticipated demand.\\n\\nGlobal demand for refined zinc is now projected to increase by 1.1 per cent to 13.59 million tonne in this year, which is lower than the April projection of 13.80 million tonne. This reduction is attributed to tight monetary conditions.\\n\\nZinc prices are finding some support from hopes for China's economic recovery, positive PMI data, and reports of additional stimulus measures. Expectations of reduced production from Europe and Australia are also limiting the price decline.\\n\\nGlobal refined zinc metal production is forecasted to rise by 3.7 per cent to 13.84 million tonne in 2023 and by 3.3 per cent to 14.30 million tonne next year. This increase is mainly driven by a substantial rise in production in China.\\n\\nTotal London Metal Exchange zinc stocks have experienced fluctuations. They rose to 99,100 tonnes so far in October, up from 30,475 tonnes at the beginning of the year. However, since their peak on August 31 at 153,975 tonne, global stocks have declined by 35.6 per cent from August to October.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 11:19Stock Market Live Updates: TCS Q2 net profit expected to rise 1.1 per cent to \\u20b911,193 crore\\n\\nIT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will report earnings for the quarter ended September 2023 on Wednesday, October 11. The TCS board will also consider a buyback of shares on Wednesday.\\n\\nAs recessionary headwinds continue unabated, the Q2FY24 results for the overall information technology (IT) sector are expected to be muted, in continuation with the previous quarter, analysts said.\\n\\nRevenue growth in the IT sector is likely to be modest, dragged by lower discretionary tech spends, and a delay in execution of deals. However, demand stays solid -- likely to show up in strong deal flows yet again -- which should translate to a strong recovery in H2FY24, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.\\n\\nTCS' net profit in the second quarter of FY24 is expected to rise by 1.1 per cent to \\u20b911,193.4 crore from \\u20b911,074 crore in the previous quarter.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 11:12Stock Market Live Updates: Vodafone Idea stock rises by 5.43% on the NSE, trading at \\u20b911.65 October 11, 2023 11:11Stock Market Live Updates: Pakka Ltd stock jumps 19.99% on the NSE, trading at \\u20b9260.50 October 11, 2023 11:11Stock Market Live Updates: Major gainers and losers on the BSE at 11\\n\\nMajor gainers: Laxmi Organics (11.45%); Mishra Dhatu Nigam (10.08%); TNPL (8.18%); Sharda Corp (7.17%); West Coast Paper Mills (6.82%)\\n\\nMajor losers: Bank of Baroda (-3.24%); ICICI Prudential (-2.15%); PCBL (-1.93%); OIL (-1.88%); Polymed (-1.75%)\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 11:06Stock Market Live Updates: Top gainers of Nifty Realty stocks Phoenix Mills (2.74%)Prestige (2.27%)Lodha (1.81%)Mahindra Lifespace Developers (1.48%)October 11, 2023 11:02Stock Market Live Updates: Naukri stock inches up by 0.72%\\n\\nRedstart Labs (India) Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Info Edge (India) (Naukri), has agreed to invest about $4,00,000 in Ray IOT Solutions Inc. at applicable exchange rate.\\n\\nNaukri stock inches up by 0.72% on the NSE, trading at \\u20b94,264.65.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 11:02Stock Market Live Updates: AIA Engineering stock is down by 0.95%\\n\\nAIA Engineering informed the exchange that the mining products business of Mining Products and Service Pty. ttd., (MPS), Australia has been transferred to VEGA MPS PTY LIMITED, Australia and Vega Industries (Middle East) FZC, UAE, a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company has acquired 30% stake in VMPS, Australia at a total consideration of AUD 7,860,000.\\n\\nAIA Engineering stock is down by 0.95% on the NSE, trading at \\u20b93,430.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2023 11:00Bank Nifty prediction today -- Oct 11, 2023: Index has good chance to rally\\n\\nBank Nifty opened today's session with a gap-up at 44,555 versus yesterday's close of 44,360.

If the undertone of the market is bullish the market will climb worrying walls which may appear formidable. It is important to appreciate the fact that even in the midst of the West Asian crisis, markets are resilient, globally. The fundamental support to the market comes from the resilience of the US economy, the declining US bond yields and the hope that the Israel-Hamas conflict will remain a localised crisis which will not impact crude prices. However, investors should remain cautious since the situation taking a turn for the worse cannot be ruled out.\\n\\nThe fact that Nifty is just 2.5% away from the all-time high indicates the strength and resilience of the market. Even though FIIs are sustained sellers in the market, buying by DIIs, HNIs and retail are counterbalancing the selling and supporting the market.

      "    \"body\": \"As required by the UK Listing Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 4.1 and 6.3, Crown Place VCT PLC today makes public its information relating to the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of Directors on 11 October 2023.\\n\\nThis announcement has not been audited.\\n\\nThe Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 (which have been audited), will shortly be sent to shareholders. Copies of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements will be shown via the Albion Capital Group LLP website by clicking www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN/30Jun23.pdf.\\n\\nInvestment policy\\n\\nThe Company invests in a broad portfolio of smaller, unquoted growth businesses across a variety of sectors including higher risk technology companies. Investments take the form of equity or a mixture of equity and loans.\\n\\nWhilst allocation of funds is determined by the investment opportunities which are available, efforts are made to ensure that the portfolio is diversified both in terms of sector and stage of maturity of investee businesses. Funds held pending investment or for liquidity purposes will be held principally as cash on deposit.\\n\\nRisk diversification and maximum exposures\\n\\nRisk is spread by investing in a number of different businesses within Venture Capital Trust qualifying industry sectors using a mixture of securities, as permitted. The maximum amount which the Company will invest in a single portfolio company is 15% of the Company's assets at cost thus ensuring a spread of investment risk. The value of an individual investment may increase over time as a result of trading progress and it is possible that it may grow in value to a point where it represents a significantly higher proportion of total assets prior to a realisation opportunity being available.\\n\\nThe Company's maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the amount of its adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not have any intention of utilising long-term gearing.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080 These are considered Alternative Performance Measures, see notes 2 and 3 of the Strategic report below for further explanation.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n(i)\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 Prior to 6 April 1999, Venture Capital Trusts were able to add 20% to dividends and figures for the period up until 6 April 1999 are included at the gross equivalent rate actually paid to shareholders.\\n\\nA more detailed breakdown of the dividends paid per year can be found at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN under the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Dividend History\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 section.\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share payable on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nChairman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s statement\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe year saw the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s portfolio facing a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop due to high inflation, rising interest rates and political instability which has caused the valuation of quoted technology companies to fall sharply. In spite of this, I am pleased to report an increase in total shareholder value of 1.06 pence per share for the year ended 30 June 2023, representing a 3.1% uplift on the opening net asset value.\\n\\nAlthough the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s portfolio faces uncertainties, the Board remains encouraged by the progress that is being made by many of the portfolio companies. The Board recognises the importance of evaluating the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s returns over the longer-term, as a venture capital portfolio can, by its nature, experience periods of short term volatility.\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nAs at 30 June 2023, the net asset value (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNAV\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) was \\u00c2\\u00a394.0 million or 33.13 pence per share compared with \\u00c2\\u00a385.8 million or 33.70 pence per share at 30 June 2022. The continuing progress of a number of our portfolio companies is discussed later in this statement and in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nIn line with the dividend policy targeting payment of around 5.0% of NAV per annum, the Company paid ordinary dividends of 1.63 pence per share during the year to 30 June 2023, which equates to 4.8% of the opening NAV (30 June 2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share).\\n\\nThe Board is pleased to declare a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share, representing 2.5% of the prevailing NAV, to be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nInvestment performance and progress\\n\\nOur portfolio has performed well despite the global uncertainties faced, and this has contributed to the total uplift in value of \\u00c2\\u00a33.8 million to the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s investments for the year (30 June 2022: \\u00c2\\u00a36.4 million). Quantexa, the largest company within our portfolio (18% of net asset value), was the main contributor to the net gain, increasing its value by \\u00c2\\u00a36.8 million following an externally led $129 million Series E fundraising which completed in April 2023. Other unrealised gains in the year, again driven by strong trading and revenue growth, included Convertr of \\u00c2\\u00a30.6 million and Solidatus of \\u00c2\\u00a30.5 million. These gains were partially offset by write downs in Black Swan which decreased by \\u00c2\\u00a31.5 million, uMotif by \\u00c2\\u00a30.9 million and Oviva by \\u00c2\\u00a30.8 million.\\n\\nThe Company realised disposal proceeds of \\u00c2\\u00a30.7 million (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a37.2 million). The largest disposals being a part disposal of our shareholding in our AIM quoted investment, Arecor Therapeutics PLC (\\u00c2\\u00a30.3 million) and an exit of Zift (\\u00c2\\u00a30.2 million). There were also several investments written off during the year, however their valuations had already been substantially reduced in previous years and had little impact on the return for the year. Further details on the realisations during the year can be found in the realisations table on page 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe three largest investments in the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s portfolio, Quantexa, Proveca and Radnor House are valued at \\u00c2\\u00a324.8 million and represent 26.4% of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s net asset value. The company regularly monitors its concentration risk and as announced on 6 October 2023, the Company sold \\u00c2\\u00a31.2 million of its holding in Quantexa at its current valuation to reduce its concentration risk.\\n\\nThe Company has been an active investor during the year with \\u00c2\\u00a37.9 million invested in 11 new and 11 existing portfolio companies. The new portfolio companies are expected to require further investment as the companies prove themselves and grow. The following are the five largest new investments:\\n\\nA full list of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s investments and disposals, including their movements in value for the year, can be found in the Portfolio of investments section on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nBoard composition\\n\\nI have had the privilege of serving as a Director of the Company for nine years, including three as Chairman, and I will retire at the Annual General Meeting in November 2023. I am delighted that James Agnew, an existing Board member, will succeed me as Chairman.\\n\\nFollowing a formal selection process and as part of its ongoing succession planning, the Board is pleased to welcome Tony Ellingham who joined the Board on 1 September 2023.\\n\\nWhen James Agnew becomes Chairman of the Board, Tony Ellingham will become the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee; Pam Garside will become the Senior Independent Director; and Ian Spence will become Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.\\n\\nRisks and uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company faces a number of significant risks, including higher interest rates, high levels of inflation, the ongoing impact of geopolitical tensions, and an expected period of economic stagnation in the UK and other markets. This complex backdrop is factored into how the Company is managed, including in its management of cash.\\n\\nOur investment portfolio, while concentrated mainly in the technology and healthcare sectors, remains diversified in terms of both sub-sector and stage of maturity and, importantly, we believe it to be appropriately valued.\\n\\nThe Manager is continually assessing the exposure to these risks for each portfolio company and appropriate actions, where possible, are being implemented. This includes the potential provision of further financial support to portfolio companies where necessary.\\n\\nA detailed analysis of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business is shown in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nShare buy-backs and reserves\\n\\nIt remains the Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s primary objective to maintain sufficient resources for investment in existing and new portfolio companies and for the continued payment of dividends to shareholders. The Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s policy is to buy back shares in the market, subject to the overall constraint that such purchases are in the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s interest. It is the Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s intention for such buy-backs to be in the region of a 5% discount to net asset value, so far as market conditions and liquidity permit.\\n\\nThe Company also manages a relatively high level of distributable reserves which can be used for share buy-backs and the payment of dividends. As in the past, the Company has sought authority from shareholders for the reclassification of the share premium account to create additional distributable reserves, which is being done again this year as explained on page 50 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nAlbion VCTs Prospectus Top Up Offers\\n\\nYour Board, in conjunction with the boards of the other five VCTs managed by Albion Capital Group LLP, launched a prospectus top up Offer of new Ordinary shares on 10 October 2022.

You will receive an email confirmation of your place, subject to availability.\\n\\nMore details are available on the Albion Capital website: www.albion.capital.\\n\\nOutlook and prospects\\n\\nThe Board is encouraged by the positive results for the year just ended in what are uncertain times, principally outside the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s control. The Board believes the portfolio is well diversified in terms of maturity and target sectors, many of which do not depend on consumer sentiment. Therefore, the Board continues to have confidence that the Company is well positioned in the current economic environment to generate long term value for shareholders.\\n\\nCrown Place VCT PLC (the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cCompany\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) is a Venture Capital Trust and its investment policy can be found above.\\n\\nBusiness model\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, the Company has no employees and has outsourced the management of all its operations to Albion Capital Group LLP, including secretarial and administrative services. Further details of the Investment Management Agreement can be found below.\\n\\nCurrent portfolio sector allocation\\n\\nThe pie charts at the end of this announcement are a useful way of showing the split of the portfolio valuation as at 30 June 2023 by: sector; stage of investment measured by revenues; and size measured by number of employees. Details of the principal investments made by the Company are shown in the Portfolio of investments on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nDirection of portfolio\\n\\nThe analysis of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s investment portfolio shows that it is well diversified and spread across the FinTech, healthcare (including digital healthcare), software and technology, renewable energy, and education sectors.\\n\\nCash and net current assets are a significant proportion of the portfolio at 28%. The main use of these funds will be to invest in higher growth technology companies, and therefore the shift away from asset based companies will continue. The funds will also be used to pay dividends, buyback shares and for the operating expenses of the Company. The Company has a significant speciality in healthcare, FinTech and software investing, which account for 58% of the net asset value of the Company.\\u00c2\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nThe Company paid dividends totalling 1.63 pence per share during the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: 3.21 pence per share which included a 1.50 pence per share special dividend). The dividend objective of the Board is to provide shareholders with a regular dividend flow. The Board declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This dividend will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nAs shown in the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Income statement below, the total return for the year was 1.05 pence per share (2022: 2.09 pence per share). The net asset value decreased to 33.13 pence per share (2022: 33.70 pence per share). This decrease in net asset value was primarily due to the payment of 1.63 pence per share of dividends during the year, partly offset by the total return in the year.\\n\\nInvestment income has increased to \\u00c2\\u00a3936,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3853,000). This is a result of bank interest and income from fixed term funds increasing to \\u00c2\\u00a3283,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a317,000) as a result of rising interest rates. Loan stock income decreased to \\u00c2\\u00a3569,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3763,000) as the prior year included a large payment of previously capitalised interest.\\n\\nThe gain on investments for the year was \\u00c2\\u00a33,846,000 (2022: gain of \\u00c2\\u00a36,386,000). The key drivers of this gain are detailed in the Chairman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s statement above. A full analysis of the Portfolio of investments can be seen on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\n\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2\\n\\nThe net cash flow for the Company has been a net outflow of \\u00c2\\u00a33,018,000 for the year (2022: inflow of \\u00c2\\u00a3598,000), reflecting new investments, dividends paid, ongoing expenses and the buy-back of shares, offset by disposal proceeds, loan stock income, and the issue of new Ordinary shares under the Top Up Offer.\\n\\nReview of the business and future changes\\n\\nA detailed review of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s business during the year is contained in the Chairman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s statement above.\\n\\nThere is a continuing focus on growing the healthcare (including digital healthcare), FinTech and software and other technology sectors. The majority of these investment returns are delivered through equity and capital gains and are expected to be the key driver of success for the Company. Investment income, which is received primarily from our renewable energy investments, is expected to remain steady over the coming years.\\n\\nDetails of significant events which have occurred since the end of the financial year are listed in note 19. Details of transactions with the Manager are shown in note 5.\\n\\nFuture prospects\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s financial results for the year ended 30 June 2023 demonstrate that the portfolio remains well balanced across sectors and risk classes, and is largely weathering the ongoing global issues caused as a result of high levels of interest rates and inflation, and other economic headwinds. Although there remains much uncertainty, the Board considers that the current portfolio and the pipeline of opportunities should enable the Company to maintain a predictable stream of dividend payments to shareholders, as well as delivering long term growth for shareholders. Further details on the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s outlook and prospects can be found in the Chairman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s statement above.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cKPIs\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) and Alternative Performance Measures (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAPMs\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d)\\n\\nThe Directors believe that the following KPIs (some of which are APMs), which are typical for Venture Capital Trusts, used in its own assessment of the Company, will provide shareholders with sufficient information to assess how effectively the Company is applying its investment policy to meet its objectives. The Directors are satisfied that the results shown in the following KPIs and APMs give a good indication that the Company is achieving its investment objective and policy. These are:\\n\\nThe graph on page 8 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements shows the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s total shareholder value relative to the FTSE All-Share Index total return, with dividends reinvested. The FTSE All-Share Index is considered a reasonable benchmark as the Company is classed as a generalist UK VCT investor, and this index includes over 600 companies listed in the UK, including small-cap, covering a range of sectors. Details on the performance of the net asset value and return per share for the year are shown in the Chairman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s statement.\\n\\nTotal shareholder value increased by 1.06 pence per share to 101.31 pence per share (2022: 100.25) for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\n2. Movement in shareholder value in the year \\u00e2\\u0080\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080 Methodology: Calculated as the movement in total shareholder value for the year divided by the opening net asset value.\\n\\n3. Dividend distributions\\n\\nDividends paid in respect of the year ended 30 June 2023 were 1.63 pence per share (2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share). Cumulative dividends paid since launch (on 18 January 1998) amount to 68.18 pence per share.\\n\\n4. Ongoing charges\\n\\nThe ongoing charges ratio for the year ended 30 June 2023 was 2.20% (2022: 2.18%). The ongoing charges ratio has been calculated using The Association of Investment Companies\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAIC\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) recommended methodology. This figure shows shareholders the total recurring annual running expenses (including investment management fees charged to capital reserve, but excluding any performance incentive fees) as a percentage of the average net assets attributable to shareholders. The Directors expect the ongoing charges ratio for the year ahead to remain stable at approximately 2.20%.\\n\\n5. VCT compliance*\\n\\nThe investment policy is designed to ensure that the Company continues to qualify and is approved as a VCT by HMRC. In order to maintain its status under Venture Capital Trust legislation, a VCT must comply on a continuing basis with the provisions of Section 274 of the Income Tax Act 2007, details of which are provided in the Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 report on page 46 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe relevant tests to measure compliance have been carried out and independently reviewed for the year ended 30 June 2023. These showed that the Company has complied with all tests and continues to do so.\\n\\n*VCT compliance is not a numerical measure of performance and thus cannot be defined as an APM.\\n\\nGearing\\n\\nAs defined by the Articles of Association, the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not currently have any intention to utilise gearing for the Company.\\n\\nOperational arrangements\\n\\nThe Company has delegated the investment management of the portfolio to the Manager, Albion Capital Group LLP, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The Manager also provides company secretarial and other accounting and administrative support to the Company.\\n\\nInvestment Management Agreement\\n\\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIMA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d), the Manager provides investment management, secretarial and administrative services to the Company. The IMA can be terminated by either party on 12 months\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 notice and is subject to earlier termination in the event of certain breaches or on the insolvency of either party. The Manager is paid an annual fee equal to 1.75% of the net asset value of the Company, and an annual secretarial and administrative fee of \\u00c2\\u00a350,000 per annum. Total annual expenses, including the management fee, are limited to 3% of the net asset value.\\n\\nIn some instances, the Manager is entitled to an arrangement fee, payable by a portfolio company in which the Company invests, in the region of 2.0% of the investment made, and also monitoring fees where the Manager has a representative on the portfolio company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s board.\\n\\nManagement performance incentive fee\\n\\nIn order to align the interests of the Manager and shareholders with regards to generating positive returns, the Manager is entitled to charge an incentive fee in the event that the returns exceed minimum target levels. Under the incentive arrangements, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Manager of an amount equal to 20% of such excess return that is calculated for each financial year.\\n\\nThe performance hurdle requires that the growth of the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period (both revenue and capital), compared with the previous accounting date, exceeds the average base rate of the Royal Bank of Scotland plc plus 2.0%. If the target return is not achieved in a period, the cumulative shortfall is carried forward to the next accounting period and has to be made up before an incentive fee becomes payable.\\n\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023, the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period amounted to 34.76 pence per share, compared to a hurdle of 35.69 pence per share. As a result, no performance incentive fee is payable to the Manager (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3584,000).\\n\\nInvestment and co-investment\\n\\nThe Company co-invests with other Venture Capital Trusts and funds managed by the Manager. Allocation of investments is on the basis of an allocation agreement which is based, inter alia, on the ratio of funds available for investment.\\n\\nEvaluation of the Manager\\n\\nThe Board has evaluated the performance of the Manager based on:\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 the returns generated by the Company;\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 the continuing achievement of the HMRC tests for VCT status;\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 the long term prospects of the current portfolio of investments;\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 the management of treasury, including use of buy-backs and participation in fund raising; and\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2\\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 benchmarking the performance of the Manager to other service providers including the performance of other VCTs that the Manager is responsible for managing.\\n\\nThe Board believes that it is in the interests of shareholders as a whole, and of the Company, to continue the appointment of the Manager for the forthcoming year.\\n\\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAIFMD\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d)\\n\\nThe Board appointed the Manager as the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s AIFM in 2014 as required by the AIFMD. The Manager is a full-scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the AIFMD. Ocorian Depositary (UK) Limited is the appointed Depositary and oversees the custody and cash arrangements and provides other AIFMD duties with respect to the Company.\\n\\nConsumer duty\\n\\nThe Consumer Duty came into effect from 31 July 2023. These new rules set a higher standard of consumer protection in financial services. The Manager as AIFM is within scope of the FCA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Consumer Duty, but the Company itself is not.\\n\\nThe Manager is a manufacturer of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s shares as it is a firm that has some influence over design and distribution of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s share product. The Manager\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s first assessment of value for the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s shares was completed in April 2023. The value assessment concluded that the Company provides fair value for shareholders.\\n\\nWhere the Manager concludes that changes will help deliver good outcomes for consumers, it will recommend these changes to the Board.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006 Section 172 Reporting\\n\\nUnder Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Board has a duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole in both the long and short term, having regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Company, such as suppliers, and to do so with an understanding of the impact on the community and environment and with high standards of business conduct, which includes acting fairly between members of the Company.\\n\\nThe Board is very conscious of these wider responsibilities in the ways it promotes the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s culture and ensures, as part of its regular oversight, that the integrity of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s affairs is foremost in the way the activities are managed and promoted. This includes regular engagement with the wider stakeholders of the Company and being alert to issues that might damage the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s standing in the way that it operates. The Board works very closely with the Manager in reviewing how stakeholder issues are handled, ensuring good governance and responsibility in managing the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s affairs, as well as visibility and openness in how the affairs are conducted.\\n\\nThe Company is an externally managed investment company with no employees, and as such has nothing to report in relation to employee engagement but does keep close attention to how the Board operates as a cohesive and competent unit. The Company also has no customers in the traditional sense and, therefore, there is also nothing to report in relation to relationships with customers.\\n\\nThe table that follows sets out the key stakeholders, details how the Board has engaged with these key stakeholders, and the effect of these considerations on the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s decisions and strategies during the year.\\n\\nSocial and community issues, employees and human rights\\n\\nThe Board recognises the requirement under section 414C of the Act to detail information about social and community issues, employees and human rights; including any policies it has in relation to these matters and effectiveness of these policies. As an externally managed investment company with no employees, the Company has no formal policies in these matters, however, it is at the core of its responsible investment strategy as detailed above.\\n\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGDPR\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) has the objective of unifying data privacy requirements across the European Union. GDPR forms part of the UK law after Brexit, now known as UK GDPR. The Manager continues to take action to ensure that the Manager and the Company are compliant with the regulation.\\n\\nFurther policies\\n\\nThe Company has adopted a number of further policies relating to:\\n\\nand these are set out in the Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 report on page 47 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nRisk management\\n\\nThe Board carries out a regular review of the risk environment in which the Company operates, together with changes to the environment and individual risks. The Board also identifies emerging risks which might impact on the Company. In the period the most noticeable risks have been rising interest rates and inflation, caused in part as a result of the geopolitical tensions, and pricing volatility in world markets, particularly affecting growth stocks. The full impact of these risks are likely to continue to be uncertain for some time.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s principal risks and uncertainties and seeks to mitigate these risks through regular reviews of performance and monitoring progress and compliance. The Board applies the principles detailed in the Financial Reporting Council\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, in the mitigation and management of these risks. More information on specific mitigation measures for the principal risks and uncertainties are explained below:\\n\\nViability statement\\n\\nIn accordance with the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2018 and provision 36 of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over three years to 30 June 2026. The Directors believe that three years is a reasonable period in which they can assess the ability of the Company to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. This is the period used by the Board as part of its strategic planning process, which includes: the estimated timelines for finding, assessing and completing investments; the potential impact of any new regulations; and the availability of cash.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company, including those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, and focused on the major factors which affect the economic, regulatory and political environment. The Board carefully assessed, and were satisfied with, the risk management processes in place to avoid or reduce the impact of these risks. The Board has carried out robust stress testing of cashflows which included; factoring in higher levels of inflation when budgeting for future expenses, only including proceeds from investment disposals where there is a high probability of completion, whilst also assessing the requirement for any future financial support of portfolio companies.\\n\\nThe Board has additionally considered the ability of the Company to comply with the ongoing conditions to ensure it maintains its VCT qualifying status under its current investment policy. As a result of the Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s quarterly valuation reviews, it has concluded that the portfolio is well balanced and geared towards delivering long term growth and strong returns to shareholders.\\n\\nThe Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to 30 June 2026. The Board is mindful of the ongoing risks and will continue to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, in addition to monitoring the quarterly cashflow forecasts to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006\\n\\nThis Strategic report of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2023 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 (the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAct\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d).

Accounting policies\\n\\nFixed asset investments\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth. This portfolio of financial assets is managed, and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment policy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board.\\n\\nIn accordance with the requirements of FRS 102, those undertakings in which the Company holds more than 20% of the equity as part of an investment portfolio are not accounted for using the equity method. In these circumstances the investment is measured at FVTPL.\\n\\nUpon initial recognition (using trade date accounting) investments, including loan stock, are classified by the Company as FVTPL and are included at their initial fair value, which is cost (excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off to the Income statement).\\n\\nSubsequently, the investments are valued at \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098fair value\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099, which is measured as follows:\\n\\nInvestments are recognised as financial assets on legal completion of the investment contract and are de-recognised on legal completion of the sale of an investment.\\n\\nDividend income is not recognised as part of the fair value movement of an investment, but is recognised separately as investment income through the other distributable reserve when a share becomes ex-dividend.\\n\\nCurrent assets and payables\\n\\nReceivables (including debtors due after more than one year), payables and cash are carried at amortised cost, in accordance with FRS 102. Deferred consideration meets the definition of a financing transaction held at amortised cost, and interest will be recognised through capital over the credit period using the effective interest method. There are no financial liabilities other than payables.\\n\\nInvestment income\\n\\nDividend income\\n\\nDividend income is included in revenue when the investment is quoted ex-dividend.\\n\\nUnquoted loan stock income\\n\\nFixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised when the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s right to receive payment and expect settlement is established. Where interest is rolled up and/or payable at redemption then it is recognised as income unless there is reasonable doubt as to its receipt.\\n\\nFixed term funds income\\n\\nFunds income is recognised on an accruals basis using the agreed rate of interest.\\n\\nBank deposit income\\n\\nInterest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the rate of interest agreed with the bank.\\n\\nInvestment management fee, performance incentive fee and other expenses\\n\\nAll expenses have been accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged through the other distributable reserve except the following which are charged through the realised capital reserve:\\n\\nTaxation\\n\\nTaxation is applied on a current basis in accordance with FRS 102. Current tax is tax payable (refundable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the current period or past reporting periods using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the financial reporting date. Taxation associated with capital expenses is applied in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences at the reporting date. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements. As a VCT the Company has an exemption from tax on capital gains. The Company intends to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval as a VCT in the foreseeable future. The Company therefore, should have no material deferred tax timing differences arising in respect of the revaluation or disposal of investments and the Company has not provided for any deferred tax.\\n\\nReserves\\n\\nCalled-up share capital\\n\\nThis accounts for the nominal value of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s shares.\\n\\nShare premium\\n\\nThis accounts for the difference between the price paid for shares and the nominal value of the shares, less issue costs and transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nCapital redemption reserve\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for amounts by which the issued share capital is diminished through the repurchase and cancellation of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s own shares, less any transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nUnrealised capital reserve\\n\\nIncreases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end against cost are included in this reserve.\\n\\nRealised capital reserve\\n\\nThe following are disclosed in this reserve:\\n\\nOther distributable reserve\\n\\nThe special reserve, treasury share reserve and the revenue reserve were combined in 2012 to form a single reserve named other distributable reserve.\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for movements from the revenue column of the Income statement, the payment of dividends, the buy-back of shares, transfers from the share premium and capital redemption reserve, and other non-capital realised movements.\\n\\nDividends\\n\\nDividends by the Company are accounted for when the liability to make the payment (record date) has been established.\\n\\nSegmental reporting\\n\\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single operating segment of business, being investment in smaller companies principally based in the UK.\\n\\nFurther details of the Investment Management Agreement under which the investment manager\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fee is paid are given in the Strategic report above.\\n\\nDuring the year, services of a total value of \\u00c2\\u00a31,583,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a31,425,000) were purchased by the Company from Albion Capital Group LLP (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAlbion\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) comprising \\u00c2\\u00a31,533,000 of management fees (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a31,375,000) and \\u00c2\\u00a350,000 of administration fees (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a350,000). There is no performance incentive fee payable this year (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3584,000). At the financial year end, the amount due to Albion in respect of these services disclosed as accruals and deferred income was \\u00c2\\u00a3422,500 (administration fee accrual: \\u00c2\\u00a312,500, management fee accrual \\u00c2\\u00a3410,000) (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3971,500).\\n\\nAlbion is, from time to time, eligible to receive an arrangement fee and monitoring fees from portfolio companies. During the year ended 30 June 2023 fees of \\u00c2\\u00a3299,000 attributable to the investments of the Company were received pursuant to these arrangements (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3121,000).\\n\\nAlbion, its partners and staff holds 2,385,697 Ordinary shares in the Company as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThe Company entered into an offer agreement relating to the Offers pursuant to which Albion received a fee of 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the Offers and out of which Albion paid the costs of the Offers, as detailed in the Prospectus.\\n\\n6. Other expenses\\n\\n7. Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 fees\\n\\nThe amounts paid to and on behalf of the Directors during the year are as follows:\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s key management personnel are the Directors. Further information regarding Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 remuneration can be found in the Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 remuneration report on pages 61 and 62 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe tax charge for the year shown in the Income statement is lower than the average standard rate of corporation tax of 20.50% (2022: 19.0%). The differences are explained above. From 1 April 2023, the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s rate of corporation tax increased from 19% to 25%.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n(i) \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 Venture Capital Trusts are not subject to corporation tax on capital gains.\\n\\n(ii) \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 Tax relief on expenses charged to capital has been determined by allocating tax relief to expenses by reference to the applicable corporation tax rate and allocating the relief between revenue and capital in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\n(iii) \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 \\u00c2 The Company has excess management expenses of \\u00c2\\u00a321,392,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a320,279,000) that are available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of \\u00c2\\u00a35,348,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a33,853,000) has not been recognised in respect of these losses as they will be recoverable only to the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable profits.\\n\\n9. Dividends\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023. The total dividend will be approximately \\u00c2\\u00a32,354,000. All dividends are paid from the other distributable reserve.\\n\\nDuring the year, unclaimed dividends older than twelve years of \\u00c2\\u00a313,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a313,000) were returned to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Association and have been accounted for on an accruals basis.\\n\\n10. Basic and diluted return per share\\n\\nThe weighted average number of shares is calculated after adjusting for treasury shares of 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916).\\n\\nThere are no convertible instruments, derivatives or contingent share agreements in issue so basic and diluted return/(loss) per share are the same.\\n\\nPurchases and disposals detailed above may not agree to the Statement of cash flows due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as a result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both impaired and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nUnquoted fixed asset investments are valued at fair value in accordance with the IPEV guidelines as follows:\\n\\nWhen using the cost or price of a recent investment in the valuations, the Company looks to re-calibrate this price at each valuation point by reviewing progress within the investment, comparing against the initial investment thesis, assessing if there are any significant events or milestones that would indicate the value of the investment has changed and considering whether a market-based methodology (i.e. using multiples from comparable public companies) or a discounted cashflow forecast would be more appropriate. The background to the transaction is also considered when the price of investment may not be an appropriate measure of fair value, for example, disproportionate dilution of existing investors from a new investor coming on board or the market conditions at the time of investment no longer being a true reflection of fair value.\\n\\nThe main inputs into the calibration exercise, and for the valuation models using multiples, are revenue, EBITDA and P/E multiples (based on the most recent revenue, EBITDA or earnings achieved and equivalent corresponding revenue, EBITDA or earnings multiples of comparable companies), quality of earnings assessments and comparability difference adjustments. Revenue multiples are often used, rather than EBITDA or earnings, due to the nature of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s investments, being in growth and technology companies which are not normally expected to achieve profitability or scale for a number of years. Where an investment has achieved scale and profitability the Company would normally then expect to switch to using an EBITDA or earnings multiple methodology.\\n\\nIn the calibration exercise and in determining the valuation for the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s equity instruments, comparable trading multiples are used. In accordance with the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s policy, appropriate comparable companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation, growth rate and strategy are determined and a trading multiple for each comparable company identified is then calculated. The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its revenue, EBITDA or earnings. The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity, marketability and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.\\n\\nFair value investments had the following movements between valuation methodologies between 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2023:\\n\\nThe valuation will be the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. The Directors believe that, within these parameters, there are no other more relevant methods of valuation which would be reasonable as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nFRS 102 and the SORP requires the Company to disclose the inputs to the valuation methods applied to its investments measured at FVTPL in a fair value hierarchy. The table below sets out fair value hierarchy definitions using FRS 102 s.11.27.\\n\\nQuoted investments are valued according to Level 1 valuation methods. Unquoted equity, preference shares and loan stock are all valued according to Level 3 valuation methods.\\n\\nInvestments held at fair value through profit or loss (Level 3) had the following movements:\\n\\n*Additions and disposals do not agree to the cash flow due to loan stock conversions and non-cash consideration.\\n\\nFRS 102 requires the Directors to consider the impact of changing one or more of the inputs used as part of the valuation process to reasonable possible alternative assumptions. 70% of the portfolio of investments, consisting of equity and loan stock, is based on recent investment price, net assets and cost. For the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has considered the reasonable possible alternative input assumptions on the valuation of the portfolio and believes that changes to inputs (by adjusting the earnings and revenue multiples) could lead to a change in the fair value of the portfolio. Therefore, for the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has adjusted the inputs for a number of the largest portfolio companies (by value) resulting in a total coverage of 84% of the portfolio of investments. The main inputs considered for each type of valuation is as follows:\\n\\n* As detailed in the accounting policies above, the base case is based on market comparables, discounted where appropriate for marketability, in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\\n\\nThe impact of these changes could result in an overall increase in the valuation of the unquoted equity investments by \\u00c2\\u00a3997,000 (1.7%) or a decrease in the valuation of unquoted equity investments by \\u00c2\\u00a3984,000 (1.7%). Due to the size of the holding in Quantexa, a 10% change in this valuation would result in a movement of \\u00c2\\u00a31,694,000 (1.8%).\\n\\n12. Significant interests\\n\\nThe principal activity of the Company is to select and hold a portfolio of investments in unquoted securities. Although the Company, through the Manager, will, in some cases, be represented on the board of the portfolio company, it will not take a controlling interest or become involved in the management of a portfolio company. The size and structure of the companies with unquoted securities may result in certain holdings in the portfolio representing a participating interest without there being any partnership, joint venture or management consortium agreement.\\n\\nThe Company has no interests of greater than 20% of the nominal value of any class of the allotted shares in the portfolio companies as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\n13. Trade and other receivables\\n\\nThe deferred consideration under one year includes deferred proceeds from the sale of G.Network Communications in December 2020. These proceeds are receivable in January 2024, and have been discounted to present value at the prevailing market rate, including a provision for counterparty risk. This constitutes a financing transaction, and has been accounted for using the policy disclosed in note 2.\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of receivables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n14. Trade and other payables\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of payables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n15. Called-up share capital\\n\\nThe Company purchased 7,462,975 Ordinary shares for treasury (2022: 6,926,930) during the year at a total cost of \\u00c2\\u00a32,359,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a32,212,000).\\n\\nThe total number of shares held in treasury as at 30 June 2023 was 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916) representing 13.2% of the shares in issue as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme Circular dated 26 February 2009, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were allotted during the year:\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Albion VCTs\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Prospectus Top Up Offers 2022/23, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were issued during the year:\\n\\n16. Basic and diluted net asset value per share\\n\\nThe basic and diluted net asset value per share at the year end is calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association and are based upon total shares in issue (adjusted for treasury shares) of 283,598,815 shares as at 30 June 2023 (2022: 254,700,921).\\n\\n17. Capital and financial instruments risk management\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s capital comprises Ordinary shares as described in note 15. The Company is permitted to buy back its own shares for cancellation or treasury purposes.\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s financial instruments comprise equity and loan stock investments in quoted and unquoted companies, cash balances and short term receivables and payables which arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to generate cash flow, revenue and capital appreciation for the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s operations. The Company has no gearing or other financial liabilities apart from short term payables. The Company does not use any derivatives for the management of its Balance sheet.\\n\\nThe principal risks arising from the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s operations are:\\n\\nThe Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. There have been no changes in the nature of the risks that the Company has faced during the past year and there have been no changes in the objectives, policies or processes for managing risks during the past year. The key risks are summarised below:\\n\\nMarket risk\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, it is the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s specific nature to evaluate the market risk of its portfolio in unquoted companies. Market risk is the exposure of the Company to the revaluation and devaluation of investments as a result of macroeconomic changes. The main driver of market risk is the dynamics of market quoted comparators, as well as the financial and operational performance of portfolio companies. The Board seeks to reduce this risk by having a spread of investments across a variety of sectors. More details on the sectors the Company invests in can be found in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review market risk, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Board monitors the prices at which sales of investments are made to ensure that profits to the Company are maximised, and that valuations of investments retained within the portfolio appear sufficiently prudent and realistic compared to prices being achieved in the market for sales of unquoted investments.\\n\\nAs required under FRS 102 the Board is required to illustrate by way of a sensitivity analysis the extent to which the assets are exposed to market risk. In order to show the impact of sensitivity in market movements on the Company, a 10% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by \\u00c2\\u00a36,800,000. Accordingly, a 20% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by \\u00c2\\u00a313,600,000. Further sensitivity analysis on fixed asset investments is included in note 11.\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk)\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk) is the risk that the fair value of future investment cash flows will fluctuate due to factors specific to an investment instrument or to a market in similar instruments. The management of risk within the venture capital portfolio is addressed through careful investment selection, by diversification across different industry segments, by maintaining a wide spread of holdings in terms of financing stage and by limitation of the size of individual holdings. The Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment risk. The Directors monitor the Manager\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s compliance with the investment policy, review and agree policies for managing this risk and monitor the overall level of risk on the investment portfolio on a regular basis.\\n\\nValuations are based on the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. Details of the industries in which investments have been made are contained in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe maximum investment risk on the balance sheet date is the value of the fixed asset investment portfolio which is \\u00c2\\u00a368,000,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a357,170,000). Fixed asset investments form 72% of the net asset value on 30 June 2023 (2022: 67%).\\n\\nInterest rate risk\\n\\nIt is the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s policy to accept a degree of interest rate risk on its financial assets through the effect of interest rate changes. On the basis of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s analysis, it is estimated that a rise of 1% in all interest rates would have increased total return before tax for the year by approximately \\u00c2\\u00a3265,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3139,000). Furthermore, it was considered that a material fall in interest rates below current levels during the year would have been unlikely.\\n\\nThe weighted average interest rate applied to the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fixed rate assets during the year was approximately 7.2% (2022: 10.1%). The weighted average period to maturity for the fixed rate assets is approximately 2.1 years (2022: 2.1 years).\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s financial assets and liabilities, all denominated in pounds sterling, consist of the following:\\n\\n*The receivables do not reconcile to the Balance sheet as prepayments are not included in the above table.\\n\\nCredit risk\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk through its receivables, investment in unquoted loan stock, and through the holding of cash on deposit with banks.\\n\\nThe Manager evaluates credit risk on loan stock and other similar instruments prior to investment, and as part of its ongoing monitoring of investments. In doing this, it takes into account the extent and quality of any security held. For loan stock investments made prior to 6 April 2018, which account for 78.4% of loan stock by value, typically loan stock instruments have a fixed or floating charge, which may or may not have been subordinated, over the assets of the portfolio company in order to mitigate the gross credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies, and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment-specific credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review credit risk (including receivables) and other risks, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s total gross credit risk at 30 June 2023 was limited to \\u00c2\\u00a310,272,000 of unquoted loan stock instruments (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a38,961,000), \\u00c2\\u00a325,006,000 cash deposits with banks (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a328,024,000) and \\u00c2\\u00a31,646,000 of other receivables (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a31,835,000).\\n\\nAt the balance sheet date, the cash in bank and at hand held by the Company was held with Lloyds Bank Plc, Scottish Widows Bank plc (part of Lloyds Banking Group), Barclays Bank plc, National Westminster Bank plc and Bank of Montreal. Credit risk on cash transactions was mitigated by transacting with counterparties that are regulated entities subject to prudential supervision, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.\\n\\nThe Company has an informal policy limiting counterparty banking and floating rate note exposure to a maximum of 20% of net asset value for any one counterparty.\\n\\nThe credit profile of unquoted loan stock is described under liquidity risk.\\n\\nLiquidity risk\\n\\nLiquid assets are held as cash on current account, on deposit or short term money market account. Under the terms of its Articles, the Company has the ability to borrow up to the amount of its adjusted capital and reserves of the latest published audited Balance sheet, which amounts to \\u00c2\\u00a391,615,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a383,700,000).\\n\\nThe Company has no committed borrowing facilities as at 30 June 2023 (2022: nil) and had cash balances of \\u00c2\\u00a325,006,000 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a328,024,000). The main cash outflows are for new investments, dividends and share buy-backs, which are within the control of the Company. The Manager formally reviews the cash requirements of the Company on a monthly basis, and the Board on a quarterly basis, as part of its review of management accounts and forecasts. All of the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s financial liabilities are short term in nature and total \\u00c2\\u00a3721,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a31,224,000).\\n\\nThe carrying value of loan stock investments as analysed by expected maturity dates is as follows:\\n\\nLoan stock can be past due as a result of interest or capital not being paid in accordance with contractual terms. The cost of loan stock investments valued below cost is \\u00c2\\u00a3nil (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3681,000).\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as the result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both those valued below cost and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nIn view of the availability of adequate cash balances and the repayment profile of loan stock investments, the Board considers that the Company is subject to low liquidity risk.\\n\\nFair values of financial assets and financial liabilities\\n\\nAll the Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2023 are stated at fair value as determined by the Directors, with the exception of receivables, payables and cash which are carried at amortised cost. There are no financial liabilities other than payables. The Company\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing. It is the Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 opinion that the book value of the financial liabilities is not materially different to the fair value and all are payable within one year.\\n\\n18. Commitments and contingencies\\n\\nThe Company had no financial commitments in respect of investments at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3nil).\\n\\nThere are no contingencies or guarantees of the Company as at 30 June 2023 (2022: \\u00c2\\u00a3nil).\\n\\n19. Post balance sheet events\\n\\nSince the year end, the Company has completed the following material investment transactions:\\n\\n20. Related party transactions\\n\\nOther than transactions with the Manager as disclosed in note 5, and the Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 remuneration disclosed in the Directors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 remuneration report on page 61 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements, there are no other related party transactions or balances requiring disclosure.\\n\\n21. Other information\\n\\nThe information set out in this announcement does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts within the terms of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 for the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022, and is derived from the statutory accounts for those financial years, which have been, or in the case of the accounts for the year ended 30 June 2023, which will be, delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Auditor reported on those accounts; the reports were unqualified and did not contain a statement under s498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\\n\\n22. Publication\\n\\nThe full audited Annual Report and Financial Statements are being sent to shareholders and copies will be made available to the public at the registered office of the Company, Companies House, the National Storage Mechanism and also electronically at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN, where the Report can be accessed via a link in the 'Financial Reports and Circulars' section.\",\n",

       " 'body': 'As required by the UK Listing Authority\\'s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 4.1 and 6.3, Crown Place VCT PLC today makes public its information relating to the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of Directors on 11 October 2023.\\n\\nThis announcement has not been audited.\\n\\nThe Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 (which have been audited), will shortly be sent to shareholders. Copies of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements will be shown via the Albion Capital Group LLP website by clicking www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN/30Jun23.pdf.\\n\\nInvestment policy\\n\\nThe Company invests in a broad portfolio of smaller, unquoted growth businesses across a variety of sectors including higher risk technology companies. Investments take the form of equity or a mixture of equity and loans.\\n\\nWhilst allocation of funds is determined by the investment opportunities which are available, efforts are made to ensure that the portfolio is diversified both in terms of sector and stage of maturity of investee businesses. Funds held pending investment or for liquidity purposes will be held principally as cash on deposit.\\n\\nRisk diversification and maximum exposures\\n\\nRisk is spread by investing in a number of different businesses within Venture Capital Trust qualifying industry sectors using a mixture of securities, as permitted. The maximum amount which the Company will invest in a single portfolio company is 15% of the Company\\'s assets at cost thus ensuring a spread of investment risk. The value of an individual investment may increase over time as a result of trading progress and it is possible that it may grow in value to a point where it represents a significantly higher proportion of total assets prior to a realisation opportunity being available.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the amount of its adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not have any intention of utilising long-term gearing.\\n\\nâ\\x80 These are considered Alternative Performance Measures, see notes 2 and 3 of the Strategic report below for further explanation.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n(i)Â Â Â Â Â Â Prior to 6 April 1999, Venture Capital Trusts were able to add 20% to dividends and figures for the period up until 6 April 1999 are included at the gross equivalent rate actually paid to shareholders.\\n\\nA more detailed breakdown of the dividends paid per year can be found at www.albion.capital/funds/CRWN under the â\\x80\\x98Dividend Historyâ\\x80\\x99 section.\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share payable on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nChairmanâ\\x80\\x99s statement\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe year saw the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s portfolio facing a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop due to high inflation, rising interest rates and political instability which has caused the valuation of quoted technology companies to fall sharply. In spite of this, I am pleased to report an increase in total shareholder value of 1.06 pence per share for the year ended 30 June 2023, representing a 3.1% uplift on the opening net asset value.\\n\\nAlthough the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s portfolio faces uncertainties, the Board remains encouraged by the progress that is being made by many of the portfolio companies. The Board recognises the importance of evaluating the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s returns over the longer-term, as a venture capital portfolio can, by its nature, experience periods of short term volatility.\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nAs at 30 June 2023, the net asset value (â\\x80\\x9cNAVâ\\x80\\x9d) was Â£94.0 million or 33.13 pence per share compared with Â£85.8 million or 33.70 pence per share at 30 June 2022. The continuing progress of a number of our portfolio companies is discussed later in this statement and in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nIn line with the dividend policy targeting payment of around 5.0% of NAV per annum, the Company paid ordinary dividends of 1.63 pence per share during the year to 30 June 2023, which equates to 4.8% of the opening NAV (30 June 2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share).\\n\\nThe Board is pleased to declare a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share, representing 2.5% of the prevailing NAV, to be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nInvestment performance and progress\\n\\nOur portfolio has performed well despite the global uncertainties faced, and this has contributed to the total uplift in value of Â£3.8 million to the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s investments for the year (30 June 2022: Â£6.4 million). Quantexa, the largest company within our portfolio (18% of net asset value), was the main contributor to the net gain, increasing its value by Â£6.8 million following an externally led $129 million Series E fundraising which completed in April 2023. Other unrealised gains in the year, again driven by strong trading and revenue growth, included Convertr of Â£0.6 million and Solidatus of Â£0.5 million. These gains were partially offset by write downs in Black Swan which decreased by Â£1.5 million, uMotif by Â£0.9 million and Oviva by Â£0.8 million.\\n\\nThe Company realised disposal proceeds of Â£0.7 million (2022: Â£7.2 million). The largest disposals being a part disposal of our shareholding in our AIM quoted investment, Arecor Therapeutics PLC (Â£0.3 million) and an exit of Zift (Â£0.2 million). There were also several investments written off during the year, however their valuations had already been substantially reduced in previous years and had little impact on the return for the year. Further details on the realisations during the year can be found in the realisations table on page 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe three largest investments in the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s portfolio, Quantexa, Proveca and Radnor House are valued at Â£24.8 million and represent 26.4% of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s net asset value. The company regularly monitors its concentration risk and as announced on 6 October 2023, the Company sold Â£1.2 million of its holding in Quantexa at its current valuation to reduce its concentration risk.\\n\\nThe Company has been an active investor during the year with Â£7.9 million invested in 11 new and 11 existing portfolio companies. The new portfolio companies are expected to require further investment as the companies prove themselves and grow. The following are the five largest new investments:\\n\\nA full list of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s investments and disposals, including their movements in value for the year, can be found in the Portfolio of investments section on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nBoard composition\\n\\nI have had the privilege of serving as a Director of the Company for nine years, including three as Chairman, and I will retire at the Annual General Meeting in November 2023. I am delighted that James Agnew, an existing Board member, will succeed me as Chairman.\\n\\nFollowing a formal selection process and as part of its ongoing succession planning, the Board is pleased to welcome Tony Ellingham who joined the Board on 1 September 2023.\\n\\nWhen James Agnew becomes Chairman of the Board, Tony Ellingham will become the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee; Pam Garside will become the Senior Independent Director; and Ian Spence will become Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.\\n\\nRisks and uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company faces a number of significant risks, including higher interest rates, high levels of inflation, the ongoing impact of geopolitical tensions, and an expected period of economic stagnation in the UK and other markets. This complex backdrop is factored into how the Company is managed, including in its management of cash.\\n\\nOur investment portfolio, while concentrated mainly in the technology and healthcare sectors, remains diversified in terms of both sub-sector and stage of maturity and, importantly, we believe it to be appropriately valued.\\n\\nThe Manager is continually assessing the exposure to these risks for each portfolio company and appropriate actions, where possible, are being implemented. This includes the potential provision of further financial support to portfolio companies where necessary.\\n\\nA detailed analysis of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business is shown in the Strategic report below.\\n\\nShare buy-backs and reserves\\n\\nIt remains the Boardâ\\x80\\x99s primary objective to maintain sufficient resources for investment in existing and new portfolio companies and for the continued payment of dividends to shareholders. The Boardâ\\x80\\x99s policy is to buy back shares in the market, subject to the overall constraint that such purchases are in the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s interest. It is the Boardâ\\x80\\x99s intention for such buy-backs to be in the region of a 5% discount to net asset value, so far as market conditions and liquidity permit.\\n\\nThe Company also manages a relatively high level of distributable reserves which can be used for share buy-backs and the payment of dividends. As in the past, the Company has sought authority from shareholders for the reclassification of the share premium account to create additional distributable reserves, which is being done again this year as explained on page 50 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nAlbion VCTs Prospectus Top Up Offers\\n\\nYour Board, in conjunction with the boards of the other five VCTs managed by Albion Capital Group LLP, launched a prospectus top up Offer of new Ordinary shares on 10 October 2022. On 10 March 2023 the Offer was fully subscribed and closed to further applications raising Â£11.5 million including the overallotment facility. The Board was pleased to see the high level of demand for the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s shares from existing and new shareholders.\\n\\nThe proceeds raised by the Company pursuant to the Offer are added to the liquid resources available for investment, positioning the Company to take advantage of new investment opportunities. Details on the share allotments during the year can be found in note 15.\\n\\nAnnual General Meeting\\n\\nThe AGM will be held virtually at noon on 22 November 2023 via the Lumi platform. Information on how to participate in the live webcast can be found on the Managerâ\\x80\\x99s website www.albion.capital/vct-hub/agms-events.Â\\n\\nThe Board welcomes questions from shareholders at the AGM and shareholders will be able to ask questions using the Lumi platform during the AGM. Alternatively, shareholders can email their questions to [email protected] prior to the AGM.Â\\n\\nShareholders\\' views are important, and the Board encourages shareholders to vote on the resolutions.Â Â\\n\\nFurther details on the format and business to be conducted at the AGM can be found in the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 report on pages 49 and 50, and in the Notice of the Meeting on pages 91 and 92, of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.Â\\n\\nAudit tender process\\n\\nFollowing a formal and rigorous audit tender process, the intention is to appoint Johnston Carmichael LLP (â\\x80\\x9cJohnston Carmichaelâ\\x80\\x9d) as the new Auditor of the Company in October 2023. Johnston Carmichael will conduct the audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024. Shareholders will be asked to confirm the appointment of Johnston Carmichael at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. BDO conducted the audit of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 and their report can be found on pages 64 to 70 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Board would like to express their gratitude to BDO for their diligent service over 16 years. Further details on the tender process can be found in the Statement of corporate governance on page 56 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nShareholder seminar\\n\\nThe next Shareholder Seminar will be held at the Royal College of Surgeons, Lincolnâ\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PE on 15 November 2023 and the Board will be delighted to see as many shareholders as possible at the event. The Board and Manager are keen to interact with shareholders and look forward to sharing with you further portfolio updates, as well as answering any questions. Places are limited and to reserve a place please email [email protected] with subject heading â\\x80\\x9cShareholder Seminarâ\\x80\\x9d and include your full name. You will receive an email confirmation of your place, subject to availability.\\n\\nMore details are available on the Albion Capital website: www.albion.capital.\\n\\nOutlook and prospects\\n\\nThe Board is encouraged by the positive results for the year just ended in what are uncertain times, principally outside the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s control. The Board believes the portfolio is well diversified in terms of maturity and target sectors, many of which do not depend on consumer sentiment. Therefore, the Board continues to have confidence that the Company is well positioned in the current economic environment to generate long term value for shareholders.\\n\\nCrown Place VCT PLC (the â\\x80\\x9cCompanyâ\\x80\\x9d) is a Venture Capital Trust and its investment policy can be found above.\\n\\nBusiness model\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, the Company has no employees and has outsourced the management of all its operations to Albion Capital Group LLP, including secretarial and administrative services. Further details of the Investment Management Agreement can be found below.\\n\\nCurrent portfolio sector allocation\\n\\nThe pie charts at the end of this announcement are a useful way of showing the split of the portfolio valuation as at 30 June 2023 by: sector; stage of investment measured by revenues; and size measured by number of employees. Details of the principal investments made by the Company are shown in the Portfolio of investments on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nDirection of portfolio\\n\\nThe analysis of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s investment portfolio shows that it is well diversified and spread across the FinTech, healthcare (including digital healthcare), software and technology, renewable energy, and education sectors.\\n\\nCash and net current assets are a significant proportion of the portfolio at 28%. The main use of these funds will be to invest in higher growth technology companies, and therefore the shift away from asset based companies will continue. The funds will also be used to pay dividends, buyback shares and for the operating expenses of the Company. The Company has a significant speciality in healthcare, FinTech and software investing, which account for 58% of the net asset value of the Company.Â\\n\\nResults and dividends\\n\\nThe Company paid dividends totalling 1.63 pence per share during the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: 3.21 pence per share which included a 1.50 pence per share special dividend). The dividend objective of the Board is to provide shareholders with a regular dividend flow. The Board declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This dividend will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023.\\n\\nAs shown in the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s Income statement below, the total return for the year was 1.05 pence per share (2022: 2.09 pence per share). The net asset value decreased to 33.13 pence per share (2022: 33.70 pence per share). This decrease in net asset value was primarily due to the payment of 1.63 pence per share of dividends during the year, partly offset by the total return in the year.\\n\\nInvestment income has increased to Â£936,000 (2022: Â£853,000). This is a result of bank interest and income from fixed term funds increasing to Â£283,000 (2022: Â£17,000) as a result of rising interest rates. Loan stock income decreased to Â£569,000 (2022: Â£763,000) as the prior year included a large payment of previously capitalised interest.\\n\\nThe gain on investments for the year was Â£3,846,000 (2022: gain of Â£6,386,000). The key drivers of this gain are detailed in the Chairmanâ\\x80\\x99s statement above. A full analysis of the Portfolio of investments can be seen on pages 27 to 29 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\\n\\nThe net cash flow for the Company has been a net outflow of Â£3,018,000 for the year (2022: inflow of Â£598,000), reflecting new investments, dividends paid, ongoing expenses and the buy-back of shares, offset by disposal proceeds, loan stock income, and the issue of new Ordinary shares under the Top Up Offer.\\n\\nReview of the business and future changes\\n\\nA detailed review of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s business during the year is contained in the Chairmanâ\\x80\\x99s statement above.\\n\\nThere is a continuing focus on growing the healthcare (including digital healthcare), FinTech and software and other technology sectors. The majority of these investment returns are delivered through equity and capital gains and are expected to be the key driver of success for the Company. Investment income, which is received primarily from our renewable energy investments, is expected to remain steady over the coming years.\\n\\nDetails of significant events which have occurred since the end of the financial year are listed in note 19. Details of transactions with the Manager are shown in note 5.\\n\\nFuture prospects\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial results for the year ended 30 June 2023 demonstrate that the portfolio remains well balanced across sectors and risk classes, and is largely weathering the ongoing global issues caused as a result of high levels of interest rates and inflation, and other economic headwinds. Although there remains much uncertainty, the Board considers that the current portfolio and the pipeline of opportunities should enable the Company to maintain a predictable stream of dividend payments to shareholders, as well as delivering long term growth for shareholders. Further details on the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s outlook and prospects can be found in the Chairmanâ\\x80\\x99s statement above.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators (â\\x80\\x9cKPIsâ\\x80\\x9d) and Alternative Performance Measures (â\\x80\\x9cAPMsâ\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\nThe Directors believe that the following KPIs (some of which are APMs), which are typical for Venture Capital Trusts, used in its own assessment of the Company, will provide shareholders with sufficient information to assess how effectively the Company is applying its investment policy to meet its objectives. The Directors are satisfied that the results shown in the following KPIs and APMs give a good indication that the Company is achieving its investment objective and policy. These are:\\n\\nThe graph on page 8 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements shows the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s total shareholder value relative to the FTSE All-Share Index total return, with dividends reinvested. The FTSE All-Share Index is considered a reasonable benchmark as the Company is classed as a generalist UK VCT investor, and this index includes over 600 companies listed in the UK, including small-cap, covering a range of sectors. Details on the performance of the net asset value and return per share for the year are shown in the Chairmanâ\\x80\\x99s statement.\\n\\nTotal shareholder value increased by 1.06 pence per share to 101.31 pence per share (2022: 100.25) for the year ended 30 June 2023.\\n\\n2. Movement in shareholder value in the year â\\x80\\n\\nâ\\x80 Methodology: Calculated as the movement in total shareholder value for the year divided by the opening net asset value.\\n\\n3. Dividend distributions\\n\\nDividends paid in respect of the year ended 30 June 2023 were 1.63 pence per share (2022: 3.21 pence per share, which included a special dividend of 1.50 pence per share). Cumulative dividends paid since launch (on 18 January 1998) amount to 68.18 pence per share.\\n\\n4. Ongoing charges\\n\\nThe ongoing charges ratio for the year ended 30 June 2023 was 2.20% (2022: 2.18%). The ongoing charges ratio has been calculated using The Association of Investment Companiesâ\\x80\\x99 (â\\x80\\x9cAICâ\\x80\\x9d) recommended methodology. This figure shows shareholders the total recurring annual running expenses (including investment management fees charged to capital reserve, but excluding any performance incentive fees) as a percentage of the average net assets attributable to shareholders. The Directors expect the ongoing charges ratio for the year ahead to remain stable at approximately 2.20%.\\n\\n5. VCT compliance*\\n\\nThe investment policy is designed to ensure that the Company continues to qualify and is approved as a VCT by HMRC. In order to maintain its status under Venture Capital Trust legislation, a VCT must comply on a continuing basis with the provisions of Section 274 of the Income Tax Act 2007, details of which are provided in the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 report on page 46 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe relevant tests to measure compliance have been carried out and independently reviewed for the year ended 30 June 2023. These showed that the Company has complied with all tests and continues to do so.\\n\\n*VCT compliance is not a numerical measure of performance and thus cannot be defined as an APM.\\n\\nGearing\\n\\nAs defined by the Articles of Association, the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s maximum exposure in relation to gearing is restricted to the adjusted share capital and reserves. The Directors do not currently have any intention to utilise gearing for the Company.\\n\\nOperational arrangements\\n\\nThe Company has delegated the investment management of the portfolio to the Manager, Albion Capital Group LLP, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The Manager also provides company secretarial and other accounting and administrative support to the Company.\\n\\nInvestment Management Agreement\\n\\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement (â\\x80\\x9cIMAâ\\x80\\x9d), the Manager provides investment management, secretarial and administrative services to the Company. The IMA can be terminated by either party on 12 monthsâ\\x80\\x99 notice and is subject to earlier termination in the event of certain breaches or on the insolvency of either party. The Manager is paid an annual fee equal to 1.75% of the net asset value of the Company, and an annual secretarial and administrative fee of Â£50,000 per annum. Total annual expenses, including the management fee, are limited to 3% of the net asset value.\\n\\nIn some instances, the Manager is entitled to an arrangement fee, payable by a portfolio company in which the Company invests, in the region of 2.0% of the investment made, and also monitoring fees where the Manager has a representative on the portfolio companyâ\\x80\\x99s board.\\n\\nManagement performance incentive fee\\n\\nIn order to align the interests of the Manager and shareholders with regards to generating positive returns, the Manager is entitled to charge an incentive fee in the event that the returns exceed minimum target levels. Under the incentive arrangements, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Manager of an amount equal to 20% of such excess return that is calculated for each financial year.\\n\\nThe performance hurdle requires that the growth of the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period (both revenue and capital), compared with the previous accounting date, exceeds the average base rate of the Royal Bank of Scotland plc plus 2.0%. If the target return is not achieved in a period, the cumulative shortfall is carried forward to the next accounting period and has to be made up before an incentive fee becomes payable.\\n\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023, the aggregate of the net asset value per share and dividends paid by the Company or declared by the Board and approved by the shareholders during the relevant period amounted to 34.76 pence per share, compared to a hurdle of 35.69 pence per share. As a result, no performance incentive fee is payable to the Manager (2022: Â£584,000).\\n\\nInvestment and co-investment\\n\\nThe Company co-invests with other Venture Capital Trusts and funds managed by the Manager. Allocation of investments is on the basis of an allocation agreement which is based, inter alia, on the ratio of funds available for investment.\\n\\nEvaluation of the Manager\\n\\nThe Board has evaluated the performance of the Manager based on:\\n\\nâ\\x80¢Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the returns generated by the Company;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the continuing achievement of the HMRC tests for VCT status;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the long term prospects of the current portfolio of investments;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the management of treasury, including use of buy-backs and participation in fund raising; and\\n\\nâ\\x80¢Â Â Â Â benchmarking the performance of the Manager to other service providers including the performance of other VCTs that the Manager is responsible for managing.\\n\\nThe Board believes that it is in the interests of shareholders as a whole, and of the Company, to continue the appointment of the Manager for the forthcoming year.\\n\\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (â\\x80\\x9cAIFMDâ\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\nThe Board appointed the Manager as the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s AIFM in 2014 as required by the AIFMD. The Manager is a full-scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the AIFMD. Ocorian Depositary (UK) Limited is the appointed Depositary and oversees the custody and cash arrangements and provides other AIFMD duties with respect to the Company.\\n\\nConsumer duty\\n\\nThe Consumer Duty came into effect from 31 July 2023. These new rules set a higher standard of consumer protection in financial services. The Manager as AIFM is within scope of the FCAâ\\x80\\x99s Consumer Duty, but the Company itself is not.\\n\\nThe Manager is a manufacturer of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s shares as it is a firm that has some influence over design and distribution of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s share product. The Managerâ\\x80\\x99s first assessment of value for the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s shares was completed in April 2023. The value assessment concluded that the Company provides fair value for shareholders.\\n\\nWhere the Manager concludes that changes will help deliver good outcomes for consumers, it will recommend these changes to the Board.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006 Section 172 Reporting\\n\\nUnder Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Board has a duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole in both the long and short term, having regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Company, such as suppliers, and to do so with an understanding of the impact on the community and environment and with high standards of business conduct, which includes acting fairly between members of the Company.\\n\\nThe Board is very conscious of these wider responsibilities in the ways it promotes the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s culture and ensures, as part of its regular oversight, that the integrity of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s affairs is foremost in the way the activities are managed and promoted. This includes regular engagement with the wider stakeholders of the Company and being alert to issues that might damage the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s standing in the way that it operates. The Board works very closely with the Manager in reviewing how stakeholder issues are handled, ensuring good governance and responsibility in managing the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s affairs, as well as visibility and openness in how the affairs are conducted.\\n\\nThe Company is an externally managed investment company with no employees, and as such has nothing to report in relation to employee engagement but does keep close attention to how the Board operates as a cohesive and competent unit. The Company also has no customers in the traditional sense and, therefore, there is also nothing to report in relation to relationships with customers.\\n\\nThe table that follows sets out the key stakeholders, details how the Board has engaged with these key stakeholders, and the effect of these considerations on the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s decisions and strategies during the year.\\n\\nSocial and community issues, employees and human rights\\n\\nThe Board recognises the requirement under section 414C of the Act to detail information about social and community issues, employees and human rights; including any policies it has in relation to these matters and effectiveness of these policies. As an externally managed investment company with no employees, the Company has no formal policies in these matters, however, it is at the core of its responsible investment strategy as detailed above.\\n\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (â\\x80\\x9cGDPRâ\\x80\\x9d) has the objective of unifying data privacy requirements across the European Union. GDPR forms part of the UK law after Brexit, now known as UK GDPR. The Manager continues to take action to ensure that the Manager and the Company are compliant with the regulation.\\n\\nFurther policies\\n\\nThe Company has adopted a number of further policies relating to:\\n\\nand these are set out in the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 report on page 47 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nRisk management\\n\\nThe Board carries out a regular review of the risk environment in which the Company operates, together with changes to the environment and individual risks. The Board also identifies emerging risks which might impact on the Company. In the period the most noticeable risks have been rising interest rates and inflation, caused in part as a result of the geopolitical tensions, and pricing volatility in world markets, particularly affecting growth stocks. The full impact of these risks are likely to continue to be uncertain for some time.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s principal risks and uncertainties and seeks to mitigate these risks through regular reviews of performance and monitoring progress and compliance. The Board applies the principles detailed in the Financial Reporting Councilâ\\x80\\x99s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, in the mitigation and management of these risks. More information on specific mitigation measures for the principal risks and uncertainties are explained below:\\n\\nViability statement\\n\\nIn accordance with the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2018 and provision 36 of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over three years to 30 June 2026. The Directors believe that three years is a reasonable period in which they can assess the ability of the Company to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. This is the period used by the Board as part of its strategic planning process, which includes: the estimated timelines for finding, assessing and completing investments; the potential impact of any new regulations; and the availability of cash.\\n\\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company, including those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, and focused on the major factors which affect the economic, regulatory and political environment. The Board carefully assessed, and were satisfied with, the risk management processes in place to avoid or reduce the impact of these risks. The Board has carried out robust stress testing of cashflows which included; factoring in higher levels of inflation when budgeting for future expenses, only including proceeds from investment disposals where there is a high probability of completion, whilst also assessing the requirement for any future financial support of portfolio companies.\\n\\nThe Board has additionally considered the ability of the Company to comply with the ongoing conditions to ensure it maintains its VCT qualifying status under its current investment policy. As a result of the Boardâ\\x80\\x99s quarterly valuation reviews, it has concluded that the portfolio is well balanced and geared towards delivering long term growth and strong returns to shareholders.\\n\\nThe Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to 30 June 2026. The Board is mindful of the ongoing risks and will continue to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, in addition to monitoring the quarterly cashflow forecasts to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity.\\n\\nCompanies Act 2006\\n\\nThis Strategic report of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2023 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 (the â\\x80\\x9cActâ\\x80\\x9d). The purpose of this report is to provide Shareholders with sufficient information to enable them to assess the extent to which the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the Company in accordance with Section 172 of the Act.\\n\\nIn preparing these Financial Statements for the year to 30 June 2023, the Directors of the Company, being Penny Freer, James Agnew, Tony Ellingham, Pam Garside and Ian Spence, confirm to the best of their knowledge:\\n\\nWe consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company\\'s position, performance, business model and strategy.\\n\\nA detailed \"Statement of Directors\\' responsibilities\" is contained on page 52 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe total column of this Income statement represents the profit and loss account of the Company. The supplementary revenue and capital columns are prepared under guidance published by The Association of Investment Companies.\\n\\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these Financial Statements.\\n\\nThese Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors, and authorised for issue on 11 October 2023 and were signed on its behalf by\\n\\n* Included within these reserves is an amount of Â£12,804,000 (2022: Â£24,165,000) which is considered distributable.\\n\\nThe nature of each reserve is described in note 2 below.\\n\\nStatement of cash flows\\n\\n* Purchases and disposals detailed above do not agree to note 11 due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\n** The cost of issue of equity does not agree to the Statement of changes in equity due to prospectus fundraising amounts being received net of fees.\\n\\n*** The equity dividends paid shown in the cash flow are different to the dividends disclosed in note 9 as a result of the non-cash effect of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme.\\n\\nNotes to the Financial Statements\\n\\n1. Basis of preparation\\n\\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 (â\\x80\\x9cFRS 102â\\x80\\x9d), and with the Statement of Recommended Practice â\\x80\\x9cFinancial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trustsâ\\x80\\x9d (â\\x80\\x9cSORPâ\\x80\\x9d) issued by The Association of Investment Companies (â\\x80\\x9cAICâ\\x80\\x9d). The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and further details can be found in the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 report on page 45 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The most critical estimates and judgements relate to the determination of carrying value of investments at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (â\\x80\\x9cFVTPLâ\\x80\\x9d) in accordance with FRS 102 sections 11 and 12. The Company values investments by following the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (â\\x80\\x9cIPEVâ\\x80\\x9d) Guidelines as updated in 2022 and further detail on the valuation techniques used are outlined below.\\n\\nCompany information is shown on page 4 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\n2. Accounting policies\\n\\nFixed asset investments\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth. This portfolio of financial assets is managed, and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment policy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board.\\n\\nIn accordance with the requirements of FRS 102, those undertakings in which the Company holds more than 20% of the equity as part of an investment portfolio are not accounted for using the equity method. In these circumstances the investment is measured at FVTPL.\\n\\nUpon initial recognition (using trade date accounting) investments, including loan stock, are classified by the Company as FVTPL and are included at their initial fair value, which is cost (excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off to the Income statement).\\n\\nSubsequently, the investments are valued at â\\x80\\x98fair valueâ\\x80\\x99, which is measured as follows:\\n\\nInvestments are recognised as financial assets on legal completion of the investment contract and are de-recognised on legal completion of the sale of an investment.\\n\\nDividend income is not recognised as part of the fair value movement of an investment, but is recognised separately as investment income through the other distributable reserve when a share becomes ex-dividend.\\n\\nCurrent assets and payables\\n\\nReceivables (including debtors due after more than one year), payables and cash are carried at amortised cost, in accordance with FRS 102. Deferred consideration meets the definition of a financing transaction held at amortised cost, and interest will be recognised through capital over the credit period using the effective interest method. There are no financial liabilities other than payables.\\n\\nInvestment income\\n\\nDividend income\\n\\nDividend income is included in revenue when the investment is quoted ex-dividend.\\n\\nUnquoted loan stock income\\n\\nFixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised when the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s right to receive payment and expect settlement is established. Where interest is rolled up and/or payable at redemption then it is recognised as income unless there is reasonable doubt as to its receipt.\\n\\nFixed term funds income\\n\\nFunds income is recognised on an accruals basis using the agreed rate of interest.\\n\\nBank deposit income\\n\\nInterest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the rate of interest agreed with the bank.\\n\\nInvestment management fee, performance incentive fee and other expenses\\n\\nAll expenses have been accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged through the other distributable reserve except the following which are charged through the realised capital reserve:\\n\\nTaxation\\n\\nTaxation is applied on a current basis in accordance with FRS 102. Current tax is tax payable (refundable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the current period or past reporting periods using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the financial reporting date. Taxation associated with capital expenses is applied in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences at the reporting date. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements. As a VCT the Company has an exemption from tax on capital gains. The Company intends to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval as a VCT in the foreseeable future. The Company therefore, should have no material deferred tax timing differences arising in respect of the revaluation or disposal of investments and the Company has not provided for any deferred tax.\\n\\nReserves\\n\\nCalled-up share capital\\n\\nThis accounts for the nominal value of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s shares.\\n\\nShare premium\\n\\nThis accounts for the difference between the price paid for shares and the nominal value of the shares, less issue costs and transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nCapital redemption reserve\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for amounts by which the issued share capital is diminished through the repurchase and cancellation of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s own shares, less any transfers on cancellation of share premium once consent of the court is given.\\n\\nUnrealised capital reserve\\n\\nIncreases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end against cost are included in this reserve.\\n\\nRealised capital reserve\\n\\nThe following are disclosed in this reserve:\\n\\nOther distributable reserve\\n\\nThe special reserve, treasury share reserve and the revenue reserve were combined in 2012 to form a single reserve named other distributable reserve.\\n\\nThis reserve accounts for movements from the revenue column of the Income statement, the payment of dividends, the buy-back of shares, transfers from the share premium and capital redemption reserve, and other non-capital realised movements.\\n\\nDividends\\n\\nDividends by the Company are accounted for when the liability to make the payment (record date) has been established.\\n\\nSegmental reporting\\n\\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single operating segment of business, being investment in smaller companies principally based in the UK.\\n\\nFurther details of the Investment Management Agreement under which the investment managerâ\\x80\\x99s fee is paid are given in the Strategic report above.\\n\\nDuring the year, services of a total value of Â£1,583,000 (2022: Â£1,425,000) were purchased by the Company from Albion Capital Group LLP (â\\x80\\x9cAlbionâ\\x80\\x9d) comprising Â£1,533,000 of management fees (2022: Â£1,375,000) and Â£50,000 of administration fees (2022: Â£50,000). There is no performance incentive fee payable this year (2022: Â£584,000). At the financial year end, the amount due to Albion in respect of these services disclosed as accruals and deferred income was Â£422,500 (administration fee accrual: Â£12,500, management fee accrual Â£410,000) (2022: Â£971,500).\\n\\nAlbion is, from time to time, eligible to receive an arrangement fee and monitoring fees from portfolio companies. During the year ended 30 June 2023 fees of Â£299,000 attributable to the investments of the Company were received pursuant to these arrangements (2022: Â£121,000).\\n\\nAlbion, its partners and staff holds 2,385,697 Ordinary shares in the Company as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nThe Company entered into an offer agreement relating to the Offers pursuant to which Albion received a fee of 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the Offers and out of which Albion paid the costs of the Offers, as detailed in the Prospectus.\\n\\n6. Other expenses\\n\\n7. Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 fees\\n\\nThe amounts paid to and on behalf of the Directors during the year are as follows:\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s key management personnel are the Directors. Further information regarding Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 remuneration can be found in the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 remuneration report on pages 61 and 62 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe tax charge for the year shown in the Income statement is lower than the average standard rate of corporation tax of 20.50% (2022: 19.0%). The differences are explained above. From 1 April 2023, the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s rate of corporation tax increased from 19% to 25%.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n(i) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Venture Capital Trusts are not subject to corporation tax on capital gains.\\n\\n(ii) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Tax relief on expenses charged to capital has been determined by allocating tax relief to expenses by reference to the applicable corporation tax rate and allocating the relief between revenue and capital in accordance with the SORP.\\n\\n(iii) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Company has excess management expenses of Â£21,392,000 (2022: Â£20,279,000) that are available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of Â£5,348,000 (2022: Â£3,853,000) has not been recognised in respect of these losses as they will be recoverable only to the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable profits.\\n\\n9. Dividends\\n\\nIn addition to the dividends paid above, the Board has declared a first dividend for the year ending 30 June 2024 of 0.83 pence per share. This will be paid on 30 November 2023 to shareholders on the register on 3 November 2023. The total dividend will be approximately Â£2,354,000. All dividends are paid from the other distributable reserve.\\n\\nDuring the year, unclaimed dividends older than twelve years of Â£13,000 (2022: Â£13,000) were returned to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Association and have been accounted for on an accruals basis.\\n\\n10. Basic and diluted return per share\\n\\nThe weighted average number of shares is calculated after adjusting for treasury shares of 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916).\\n\\nThere are no convertible instruments, derivatives or contingent share agreements in issue so basic and diluted return/(loss) per share are the same.\\n\\nPurchases and disposals detailed above may not agree to the Statement of cash flows due to restructuring of investments, conversion of convertible loan stock and settlement receivables and payables.\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as a result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both impaired and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nUnquoted fixed asset investments are valued at fair value in accordance with the IPEV guidelines as follows:\\n\\nWhen using the cost or price of a recent investment in the valuations, the Company looks to re-calibrate this price at each valuation point by reviewing progress within the investment, comparing against the initial investment thesis, assessing if there are any significant events or milestones that would indicate the value of the investment has changed and considering whether a market-based methodology (i.e. using multiples from comparable public companies) or a discounted cashflow forecast would be more appropriate. The background to the transaction is also considered when the price of investment may not be an appropriate measure of fair value, for example, disproportionate dilution of existing investors from a new investor coming on board or the market conditions at the time of investment no longer being a true reflection of fair value.\\n\\nThe main inputs into the calibration exercise, and for the valuation models using multiples, are revenue, EBITDA and P/E multiples (based on the most recent revenue, EBITDA or earnings achieved and equivalent corresponding revenue, EBITDA or earnings multiples of comparable companies), quality of earnings assessments and comparability difference adjustments. Revenue multiples are often used, rather than EBITDA or earnings, due to the nature of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s investments, being in growth and technology companies which are not normally expected to achieve profitability or scale for a number of years. Where an investment has achieved scale and profitability the Company would normally then expect to switch to using an EBITDA or earnings multiple methodology.\\n\\nIn the calibration exercise and in determining the valuation for the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s equity instruments, comparable trading multiples are used. In accordance with the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s policy, appropriate comparable companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation, growth rate and strategy are determined and a trading multiple for each comparable company identified is then calculated. The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its revenue, EBITDA or earnings. The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity, marketability and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.\\n\\nFair value investments had the following movements between valuation methodologies between 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2023:\\n\\nThe valuation will be the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. The Directors believe that, within these parameters, there are no other more relevant methods of valuation which would be reasonable as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nFRS 102 and the SORP requires the Company to disclose the inputs to the valuation methods applied to its investments measured at FVTPL in a fair value hierarchy. The table below sets out fair value hierarchy definitions using FRS 102 s.11.27.\\n\\nQuoted investments are valued according to Level 1 valuation methods. Unquoted equity, preference shares and loan stock are all valued according to Level 3 valuation methods.\\n\\nInvestments held at fair value through profit or loss (Level 3) had the following movements:\\n\\n*Additions and disposals do not agree to the cash flow due to loan stock conversions and non-cash consideration.\\n\\nFRS 102 requires the Directors to consider the impact of changing one or more of the inputs used as part of the valuation process to reasonable possible alternative assumptions. 70% of the portfolio of investments, consisting of equity and loan stock, is based on recent investment price, net assets and cost. For the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has considered the reasonable possible alternative input assumptions on the valuation of the portfolio and believes that changes to inputs (by adjusting the earnings and revenue multiples) could lead to a change in the fair value of the portfolio. Therefore, for the remainder of the portfolio, the Board has adjusted the inputs for a number of the largest portfolio companies (by value) resulting in a total coverage of 84% of the portfolio of investments. The main inputs considered for each type of valuation is as follows:\\n\\n* As detailed in the accounting policies above, the base case is based on market comparables, discounted where appropriate for marketability, in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\\n\\nThe impact of these changes could result in an overall increase in the valuation of the unquoted equity investments by Â£997,000 (1.7%) or a decrease in the valuation of unquoted equity investments by Â£984,000 (1.7%). Due to the size of the holding in Quantexa, a 10% change in this valuation would result in a movement of Â£1,694,000 (1.8%).\\n\\n12. Significant interests\\n\\nThe principal activity of the Company is to select and hold a portfolio of investments in unquoted securities. Although the Company, through the Manager, will, in some cases, be represented on the board of the portfolio company, it will not take a controlling interest or become involved in the management of a portfolio company. The size and structure of the companies with unquoted securities may result in certain holdings in the portfolio representing a participating interest without there being any partnership, joint venture or management consortium agreement.\\n\\nThe Company has no interests of greater than 20% of the nominal value of any class of the allotted shares in the portfolio companies as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\n13. Trade and other receivables\\n\\nThe deferred consideration under one year includes deferred proceeds from the sale of G.Network Communications in December 2020. These proceeds are receivable in January 2024, and have been discounted to present value at the prevailing market rate, including a provision for counterparty risk. This constitutes a financing transaction, and has been accounted for using the policy disclosed in note 2.\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of receivables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n14. Trade and other payables\\n\\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of payables is not materially different to their fair value.\\n\\n15. Called-up share capital\\n\\nThe Company purchased 7,462,975 Ordinary shares for treasury (2022: 6,926,930) during the year at a total cost of Â£2,359,000 (2022: Â£2,212,000).\\n\\nThe total number of shares held in treasury as at 30 June 2023 was 43,285,891 (2022: 35,822,916) representing 13.2% of the shares in issue as at 30 June 2023.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Dividend Reinvestment Scheme Circular dated 26 February 2009, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were allotted during the year:\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Albion VCTsâ\\x80\\x99 Prospectus Top Up Offers 2022/23, the following new Ordinary shares of nominal value 1 penny each were issued during the year:\\n\\n16. Basic and diluted net asset value per share\\n\\nThe basic and diluted net asset value per share at the year end is calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association and are based upon total shares in issue (adjusted for treasury shares) of 283,598,815 shares as at 30 June 2023 (2022: 254,700,921).\\n\\n17. Capital and financial instruments risk management\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s capital comprises Ordinary shares as described in note 15. The Company is permitted to buy back its own shares for cancellation or treasury purposes.\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial instruments comprise equity and loan stock investments in quoted and unquoted companies, cash balances and short term receivables and payables which arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to generate cash flow, revenue and capital appreciation for the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s operations. The Company has no gearing or other financial liabilities apart from short term payables. The Company does not use any derivatives for the management of its Balance sheet.\\n\\nThe principal risks arising from the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s operations are:\\n\\nThe Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. There have been no changes in the nature of the risks that the Company has faced during the past year and there have been no changes in the objectives, policies or processes for managing risks during the past year. The key risks are summarised below:\\n\\nMarket risk\\n\\nAs a Venture Capital Trust, it is the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s specific nature to evaluate the market risk of its portfolio in unquoted companies. Market risk is the exposure of the Company to the revaluation and devaluation of investments as a result of macroeconomic changes. The main driver of market risk is the dynamics of market quoted comparators, as well as the financial and operational performance of portfolio companies. The Board seeks to reduce this risk by having a spread of investments across a variety of sectors. More details on the sectors the Company invests in can be found in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review market risk, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Board monitors the prices at which sales of investments are made to ensure that profits to the Company are maximised, and that valuations of investments retained within the portfolio appear sufficiently prudent and realistic compared to prices being achieved in the market for sales of unquoted investments.\\n\\nAs required under FRS 102 the Board is required to illustrate by way of a sensitivity analysis the extent to which the assets are exposed to market risk. In order to show the impact of sensitivity in market movements on the Company, a 10% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by Â£6,800,000. Accordingly, a 20% increase or decrease in the valuation of the fixed asset investment portfolio (keeping all other variables constant) would increase or decrease the net asset value and return for the year by Â£13,600,000. Further sensitivity analysis on fixed asset investments is included in note 11.\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk)\\n\\nInvestment risk (including investment price risk) is the risk that the fair value of future investment cash flows will fluctuate due to factors specific to an investment instrument or to a market in similar instruments. The management of risk within the venture capital portfolio is addressed through careful investment selection, by diversification across different industry segments, by maintaining a wide spread of holdings in terms of financing stage and by limitation of the size of individual holdings. The Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment risk. The Directors monitor the Managerâ\\x80\\x99s compliance with the investment policy, review and agree policies for managing this risk and monitor the overall level of risk on the investment portfolio on a regular basis.\\n\\nValuations are based on the most appropriate valuation methodology for an investment within its market, with regard to the financial health of the investment and the IPEV Guidelines. Details of the industries in which investments have been made are contained in the pie chart at the end of this announcement.\\n\\nThe maximum investment risk on the balance sheet date is the value of the fixed asset investment portfolio which is Â£68,000,000 (2022: Â£57,170,000). Fixed asset investments form 72% of the net asset value on 30 June 2023 (2022: 67%).\\n\\nInterest rate risk\\n\\nIt is the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s policy to accept a degree of interest rate risk on its financial assets through the effect of interest rate changes. On the basis of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s analysis, it is estimated that a rise of 1% in all interest rates would have increased total return before tax for the year by approximately Â£265,000 (2022: Â£139,000). Furthermore, it was considered that a material fall in interest rates below current levels during the year would have been unlikely.\\n\\nThe weighted average interest rate applied to the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s fixed rate assets during the year was approximately 7.2% (2022: 10.1%). The weighted average period to maturity for the fixed rate assets is approximately 2.1 years (2022: 2.1 years).\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial assets and liabilities, all denominated in pounds sterling, consist of the following:\\n\\n*The receivables do not reconcile to the Balance sheet as prepayments are not included in the above table.\\n\\nCredit risk\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk through its receivables, investment in unquoted loan stock, and through the holding of cash on deposit with banks.\\n\\nThe Manager evaluates credit risk on loan stock and other similar instruments prior to investment, and as part of its ongoing monitoring of investments. In doing this, it takes into account the extent and quality of any security held. For loan stock investments made prior to 6 April 2018, which account for 78.4% of loan stock by value, typically loan stock instruments have a fixed or floating charge, which may or may not have been subordinated, over the assets of the portfolio company in order to mitigate the gross credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager receives management accounts from portfolio companies, and members of the investment management team often sit on the boards of unquoted portfolio companies; this enables the close identification, monitoring and management of investment-specific credit risk.\\n\\nThe Manager and the Board formally review credit risk (including receivables) and other risks, both at the time of initial investment and at quarterly Board meetings.\\n\\nThe Companyâ\\x80\\x99s total gross credit risk at 30 June 2023 was limited to Â£10,272,000 of unquoted loan stock instruments (2022: Â£8,961,000), Â£25,006,000 cash deposits with banks (2022: Â£28,024,000) and Â£1,646,000 of other receivables (2022: Â£1,835,000).\\n\\nAt the balance sheet date, the cash in bank and at hand held by the Company was held with Lloyds Bank Plc, Scottish Widows Bank plc (part of Lloyds Banking Group), Barclays Bank plc, National Westminster Bank plc and Bank of Montreal. Credit risk on cash transactions was mitigated by transacting with counterparties that are regulated entities subject to prudential supervision, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.\\n\\nThe Company has an informal policy limiting counterparty banking and floating rate note exposure to a maximum of 20% of net asset value for any one counterparty.\\n\\nThe credit profile of unquoted loan stock is described under liquidity risk.\\n\\nLiquidity risk\\n\\nLiquid assets are held as cash on current account, on deposit or short term money market account. Under the terms of its Articles, the Company has the ability to borrow up to the amount of its adjusted capital and reserves of the latest published audited Balance sheet, which amounts to Â£91,615,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: Â£83,700,000).\\n\\nThe Company has no committed borrowing facilities as at 30 June 2023 (2022: nil) and had cash balances of Â£25,006,000 (2022: Â£28,024,000). The main cash outflows are for new investments, dividends and share buy-backs, which are within the control of the Company. The Manager formally reviews the cash requirements of the Company on a monthly basis, and the Board on a quarterly basis, as part of its review of management accounts and forecasts. All of the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial liabilities are short term in nature and total Â£721,000 as at 30 June 2023 (2022: Â£1,224,000).\\n\\nThe carrying value of loan stock investments as analysed by expected maturity dates is as follows:\\n\\nLoan stock can be past due as a result of interest or capital not being paid in accordance with contractual terms. The cost of loan stock investments valued below cost is Â£nil (2022: Â£681,000).\\n\\nThe Company does not hold any assets as the result of the enforcement of security during the period, and believes that the carrying values for both those valued below cost and past due assets are covered by the value of security held for these loan stock investments.\\n\\nIn view of the availability of adequate cash balances and the repayment profile of loan stock investments, the Board considers that the Company is subject to low liquidity risk.\\n\\nFair values of financial assets and financial liabilities\\n\\nAll the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2023 are stated at fair value as determined by the Directors, with the exception of receivables, payables and cash which are carried at amortised cost. There are no financial liabilities other than payables. The Companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing. It is the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 opinion that the book value of the financial liabilities is not materially different to the fair value and all are payable within one year.\\n\\n18. Commitments and contingencies\\n\\nThe Company had no financial commitments in respect of investments at 30 June 2023 (2022: Â£nil).\\n\\nThere are no contingencies or guarantees of the Company as at 30 June 2023 (2022: Â£nil).\\n\\n19. Post balance sheet events\\n\\nSince the year end, the Company has completed the following material investment transactions:\\n\\n20. Related party transactions\\n\\nOther than transactions with the Manager as disclosed in note 5, and the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 remuneration disclosed in the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 remuneration report on page 61 of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements, there are no other related party transactions or balances requiring disclosure.\\n\\n21.
